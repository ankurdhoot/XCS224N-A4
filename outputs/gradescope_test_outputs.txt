So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved thing to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of it takes out of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart diseases attack the heart injury.
So you're thinking that having a high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that helps to reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and he knows that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even it's likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> the <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that is supposed to ask for that most doctors don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have a surgery on any medical procedure before it helps a person.
And it must be thinking about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not any idea of the doctor, and if it's any of someone, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number required to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This as a research on the research of researchers would <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I just explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, heart attack, or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 from <unk> my <unk>
Why don't it -- <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you must ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk> effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things that include <unk> <unk> pain and <unk> pain -- but they think, "The Five is not very likely that I happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress you don't think very clearly.
So think about how we do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has taken five percent of the 300 percent of them have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug to help you help the drug.
I don't say you should or not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic requires, is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is more done in the biggest men of 50 prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
That's how 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of that 50 percent of the effects will only take a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions you can argue before the questions that you can argue with the conversation forward.
You don't have to do this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice a lot of times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that point is that they shut up a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
It turns out to face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or your immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, not react very quickly. You could get to be the lunch of lions, so nothing really matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thinking, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to take them to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at some time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> could be able to put systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent things that bad things happen in the first place.
<unk> at night in <unk> when I came out of my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination with a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the entry door, a easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a music instrument, and you see a <unk> on the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may be never <unk> a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade in 1800, and with the time of time, they mixed with local signs, and it was developed the language that we today know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years old.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following blind their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do I understand the sound work?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example.
<unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato chips.
<unk> <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has come in my art <unk>
I'm going to ask you more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through your ears.
I can feel that in a tactile way, or a experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was amazed with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt the sound was <unk> it was something that was <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art job, or I could be able to tell me.
I chose to get <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support itself and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant to society today.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with a lot of different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as you take a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue this practice, and I feel like I could focus on <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can not be able to capture and express in the paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signals as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor for you to understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different <unk> parameters.
If you're mapping a <unk> different for each finger as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if you were <unk> only one key at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only one key <unk> would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different <unk> parameters can express different ideas.
So for example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started to think, and if I see <unk> through the glasses of the music?
If I had to create a sign of it, and you put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and it wears off.
This is all the day."
If you do it, and you <unk> the visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
All of the day.
I feel that the same can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night on this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> -- it's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite one, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk> <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think it would automatically be at <unk>
Watch <unk> hand right -- <unk> left.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of your hands.
We're now going to do it as much in your head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages all over the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please take it again.
And again, again.
Is it <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they're transmitted very differently.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> live and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> has no sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what social value defines and allow <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not that you have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to give you a little bit of your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can do everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination was led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a performance of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I should say, because adults lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I was older, I found out that adults also found out that adults are also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning each other.
The time now, I'm now adult and teach citizenship and invention in the <unk> of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for a lot of my students to walk on the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's scary.
And in the last few decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect these pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts at an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> <unk> work so that children are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will tell you the kids who manipulate electric tools are great, safe and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to the plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
We do.
I leave my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure it into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with the robots.
Then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we will transform lights and cameras on accessories. And they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measuring the size of each <unk> to get an approximate estimate of how much plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would give it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> they're trying to get it right away.
So I'm able to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get bored with this picture.
A child, maybe 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, only using the hands, in <unk> the world's largest forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown the mud and oil are also brown and when they all <unk> it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> which can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> what can help to identify what there is in the water.
So we had this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
And I can investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, and I would have a more difficult problem, and I could also address me.
I'm half Japanese and French and perhaps remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that triggered a lot of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> were destroyed many cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a moment.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power close to the water.
And today, by the reports of a 300 metric tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution of <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, has some safe thing, it's blue.
Well, it's a little more complicated than that.
And I went back to <unk> every year from the crash and independently independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to have the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here, you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Along with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust, <unk> <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this -- we organized a civil expedition the nearest close to date.
We're approaching a half miles of nuclear power, and with the <unk> assistance of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a tracking of sediment as we invented and we've built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we became the largest space that dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become really with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> asking things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheels in new <unk>
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, creators, creators, <unk> we need to make the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and to actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two radically opposite cultures of <unk>
One is made of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one string of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is the <unk> about the environment, the other thing thought I did.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo <unk> said when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only <unk>
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that they needed for every cell to work and to make it happen.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects and trained to think about their objects like <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with microscopic <unk>
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
One acts primarily like <unk> the other primarily like barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there is no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- both twice as a personality of every designer and architect to work in the <unk> and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and the growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere.
My work, on its simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from assembly and coming up to growth.
You probably ask, Why now?
Why wasn't it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special time in history, a rare time, where they produce four disciplines that offers designers to help designers that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools across scales, large-scale structures -- like this robotic arm with a very far scope of <unk> in diameter with a base of day not very far to print <unk> buildings, and graphs to the nanoscale made of genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every shadowy is only only to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion from Paris with <unk> -- it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator, we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> and you can show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner that's <unk>
That designers have access to this <unk> analytical and the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the comfortable structural and also it absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator, went back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern of surface it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, vary its functionality not by addition to the addition of other material or other <unk> but <unk> <unk> and <unk>
But this is the nature of <unk>
There's no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish life, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and actually define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God send the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, branches, <unk> and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of <unk>
Instead, the land was growing trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What would design be if the objects were made out of a single <unk>
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we look at the material that the material is <unk> the kind of material in the tree of <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of them produced every year for organisms like shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune into their properties, we could make <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked a bunch of seed husks the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures was built in a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one single material half of a single material half a long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are <unk> you dry it up to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed genetically carbon in the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> problems and if it broadens even more than windows.
A tree, <unk> <unk>
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure of carbon husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects that are designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> table, we made our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological ones within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the stone <unk>
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine
One makes the light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two thirds don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never was <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
So to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the tract tract -- that will help you make these bacteria and to make it their function as a way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the functionality that we have.
If we wanted more <unk> to <unk> more transparent channels.
This bionic system, when it stretches from one end to each other, it takes 60 meters.
This is half of the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our little <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels in the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are very remote creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, and we <unk> the kidney tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer makes material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture that is a home inside which they were <unk>
<unk> is not about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, <unk> those fibers in each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with electronic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk worm <unk>
However, when we put silk into a flat patch in a flat patch not within a box, we realized that they were <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different across different parts of us, and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> was transmitted directly through the environment.
<unk> <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates can shape <unk> silk without a single <unk>
They <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms were going to be more dark and <unk> so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light, and the heat look at the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We were doing silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to meet us with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they were <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By detecting biological silk about <unk> <unk> they give all of this pavilion their integrity.
And over two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms -- <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other empty <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give the products to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
What it takes to turn, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from a design inspired by nature to an inspired nature that demands of us, for the first time, that we make ourselves charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time this?
They can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
They have caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and I took websites, and I also played the guitar in a punk punk called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, it's no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to move on.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something completely different, and I was going to get it into it, and I would let me absorb and feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it to you.
But then I would like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denied all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason why I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad at me is not <unk> at all.
I was worried to be afraid of commitment, or to be <unk> or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked you then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did it, they learned it from culture.
So you ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were doing at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is about again and again as we are growing in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise about being the cute exercise before it takes us the dream.
Why?
If this question inspires kids to dream with what they might be, doesn't inspire me to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the other thing, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults are likely to be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You've got to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of <unk> life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to engage in during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and I devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up the curiosity and a lot of different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel it alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> to say.
Could it help if you divide in three parts: <unk> and potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we would have the same idea, as <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Buchwald refers to us as <unk>
They do any term you like or you would give you your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we cannot agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as a limitation or <unk> you must win.
But what I've learned about talking with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be in this way.
Here are three <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in a visualization of the data visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, when they found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
So the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their own, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second <unk> superpower is <unk> learning.
When we <unk> we <unk> and we are <unk>
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our zones of comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely start to zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> in full time and a American writer <unk>
As a girl would be an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it became a writer, I was <unk> it was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the smallest sales mechanics when they started their <unk> and this skill helps to write a compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to have a loss of time to do what you would tell you, even if you end up with it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third <unk> superpower is adaptability. It is, the ability to transform into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of the videos, another designer of pages -- sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes master, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their customers.
<unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the market needs -- the one that actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning, and <unk> three abilities where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're a <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they're in your heart <unk>
<unk> <unk> knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive in deep deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and careers that are connected to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them will tell them to simply be more like the <unk>
Once I said that, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart, then, if you go through all the media.
That's where you get the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes, --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep your curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
They were exploring intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> led to a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found <unk> and <unk> in the brain of the <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If I was born, I had been living today, we couldn't give her more aid than the one that he was doing, he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from <unk> lots of treatments for cancer <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But it has been moved in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people around the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to the age of 85 years or more, the ability to acquire Alzheimer's will be almost one of two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their deceased years with Alzheimer's or helping care for a friend or want Alzheimer's disease.
Already in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs will increase an increase in five times in 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been a relatively bit of <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow down its development.
We understand less Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in the Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's disease and because of a annual annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but everyone knows, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us, all scientists, scientists, Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain that is healthy compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to a severe memory loss and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's to significantly reduce life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they are made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots go wrong, and some dots are left on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
I could make nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
So you have to find the right step that you did, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the wires have been reduced to the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals and engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that they block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick each other inside of them, as humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to create that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we can do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, the drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move through HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden, caregivers of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and to help demand a cure.
Thank you.
So I had this article in the column called the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience to test it myself at the last summer of summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers were <unk> to make 36 questions more and more personal questions, and then they both look at eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with an quality or skill, which would that be?
Number one: When did the last time I read another person <unk>
And <unk>
<unk> -- these are increasingly personal.
Number one: <unk> really <unk> me, <unk> your partner what you like from him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really struck detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect <unk>
But we had no longer <unk> and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column that I send it to the column that would be there a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably will be asked, keep up with still yet.
And the reason I think of this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
One week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked myself to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends, and I imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand views.
And that's a good burden of attention to a relatively new relationship.
But as I gave it, I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday Friday night, and now a Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And the Sunday, I had already called Project Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper received more than eight million pages, and I was like, <unk> a little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with <unk> about personal experiences, but another thing is to discover that love life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or he was like, what they did every day for weeks, they were always doing the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
Several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I gave even a talk, and a woman screamed to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international paper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for St. <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public onset together.
And you call it interviews, and I would give you the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked work, they wanted to know if it was actually able to produce love -- I mean, if it was able to produce love -- not just a adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, mostly that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you put together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of doing these 36 <unk> questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for how to foster interpersonal approach, between university students, using what they <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
The participants felt more close to doing it -- multiple <unk> studies, they also used <unk> <unk> protocol -- as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used by members of the police and the community, and they used to be used by people in the opposite political issue.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you would tell you about the person with whom you <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but became better <unk>
<unk> that they were able to get better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation of separation when I was high.
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, which I was almost all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I was going to get to science.
I did all I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hoped that that could be a certain shape <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just went to the book I thought I was going to write for the book that I would write but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I joined the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I was then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful for one or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I am.
But I can also see me more clearly -- and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than it reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for love is a realistic one, not just being <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> indefinitely for the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media said about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk of risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because they fell in love -- it makes us feel <unk> but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that I ask, still together?
And their content with an answer of <unk> or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we do more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't you?
How do you stay in love when things get <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live in the doubt of your <unk>
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still continue together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love in love is not the same thing that remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> the love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I had not considered everything that there was a choice.
He didn't think of how many times we'd have to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want you to be able to have done and responded to 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone so generous, kind of fun and fun and to have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I think about, and what maybe spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love somebody, and the hope that he also would love me, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a <unk> <unk> in a way I got a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York makes a while.   One that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood and <unk> a dollar bill -- a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some of the strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> -- for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from trip and make <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee left <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I put more resin in the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: it somehow seemed that it grew up in size, as if it was that you can put the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, the strange bottles that I was finding on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> just like a <unk> in the crime scene.
And I pulled out the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, <unk> you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend over to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was beautiful man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of natural beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I would tell you.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
So I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing on a window and then another window and other window, and he had all these windows together that lined up a three-dimensional composition there.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a big measure in "The garden of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this <unk> mesh of <unk> where they <unk>
So here is where creatures with animal heads are headed to the <unk> lists of <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god strapped onto a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out of the clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> line in a <unk> line that joins the <unk>
Anyway, your tail turn into the <unk> about a <unk>
I don't know why that happened.
Things you know.
His tail ends up in a dry balloon of <unk> <unk> <unk> cards.
They've been <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball baseball cards.
Very <unk> for your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each other acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in 20 groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's taking them back.
Each one is basically a microscope of microscope that weighs 1.3 billion pounds with a human trapped in its inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's my chest, and it can be <unk>
They will accompany them by the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it does, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There is some pills that they go out and come into the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world; and a garden.
You know, we get the box and all the people in the surface of each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living on.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, from the <unk> of religion, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill. It has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug would be made in the body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients patients.
When you take drugs <unk> these are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of stem cells.
But they are also known by their side effects on their most negative side effects in their most negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the blood current -- they get worse and worse by the time that it takes to reach their destination, which is where it's more important -- in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go easily in the blood stream of patients that would be <unk> to the regulate therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells <unk>
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a life treatment for the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "You know, to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use in <unk> for the care of wounds and <unk> surgery -- they can be used for anything else -- including drug transportation.
In fact, we're using <unk> laser to open up or drill extremely small holes that open up and closed almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asking, "How is that <unk>
We launched a little laser beam on the cellular membrane infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or in plate plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it goes to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all <unk> researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups -- <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot themselves.
My goal is to better understand these agents of violence from violence to study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to the confrontation not violent.
I do business work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solve almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
It's not.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, the <unk> arrangements of peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but no one is looking at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military system.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
It's multitasking again.
They set up a complex machinery of communication stations, radio radio stations, websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to pay better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else, create stronger bonds with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run schools, run in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The ascent of Taliban in an Afghanistan torn through war, or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can also understand <unk> the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price religious highest price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling in a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 of <unk> Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups we just think on the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps from the government, and emerge as armed groups and political struggle participate in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated things are these organizations, we can less <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, running all of their <unk> collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak things are the states, like in the Middle East today, and they fill up that gap of the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in a longer military tools.
<unk> that gap of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and <unk> peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will understand better what incentives offer to encourage the transition from violence to non-violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors, military power can win some <unk> but it doesn't give us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety gap, to fill that safety of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm an failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but fear that accept openly the label tag would be unfair to the <unk>
I'm a <unk> but quite bad.
And therefore I was obsessed with a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then the people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women -- <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> -- as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women treat women around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo word.
I was <unk> as a woman who follows the rules, who calls too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I'm, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same paycheck at the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as it would be free of harassing or violence.
We have a right to use very easy and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, and much more.
We need to have to account these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make a bad feminist thing.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I'm listening to rap music at all.
Even though the letter degrades women, and it offends me deeply, the classic <unk> classic <unk> <unk> <unk> is amazing.
<unk> actually with your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get rid of the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> for my musical evidence.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I want to do, <unk> --  all of the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and all nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, and it's her choice, and I'm not who I am for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, and they agreed that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it causes women to be economically vulnerable when they <unk>
And we had this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, the gay and gay workers, favor of white women, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist a feminist feminist issue.
It also happens to the following: As <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put psychologists <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that they will play perfection.
When we hit the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I am a <unk> I already consider myself to <unk> that <unk> before I try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders and leaders are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> I'm afraid of what that tag would be -- I'm afraid that it doesn't be able to fulfill the slightly realistic expectations of it.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in front of the word <unk> of three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star <unk> openly feminism and making women and young men who are feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics began the endless debates if <unk> was or not quite a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection with <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We go so much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism percent of any woman, <unk> until it's not left.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what's next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give up the action and be a little more <unk>
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
They are two <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
And they were terrified by the strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as sports, and <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio station when we listen to songs like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when the movies are not trying to women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their partners as <unk>
In any case, men, especially young white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until you don't include a number of enough women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we will encourage participating in this kind of projects, we can also be able to get more as much as more people as people are <unk> to overcome the barriers in a decision.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, and our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small courage and hope that our decisions are going to the top, to the people in the power directors and movie producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create sustainable and significant change.
We can also tell the courage to our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, most of all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't get away to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
And the words of the women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing, and I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I make the <unk> reality, that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
So I hope that we could all be a little bit courageous, when you need a little bit more <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, had <unk> to have visited <unk> or by being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most likely diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak that they were not vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines and <unk> and <unk> by being <unk> fraud for the British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
And the few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of her creating all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence kept stable just three or four children for every <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic, as if I could get another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control from Atlanta -- what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of his son of two years, the visual contact of it.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were it so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow and slow progress of the science that we have the sense of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is, and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at <unk> Johns Hopkins <unk> in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to <unk> a private, private, private, to people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving hands in front of their faces, but they were prey to panic as when he didn't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing it.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
By the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on the subject, stated that I'd seen less than a few of the real true cases of his syndrome while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was amazed that he turned to nine of 10 children sent by other doctors to her office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of kidney whether child was caused by cold, cold parents.
And these kids, he said, they have kept it carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't get <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned two.
When his mother put one of his favorite records and he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like children were simply <unk> what they heard their parents were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970 that researchers started testing <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I thought that the theory of mothers came from <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was warm and warm people and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl as no support, no special education, without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National National Service, that you needed more resources for autistic children and their families, and their colleague Judith Gould from decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a prevalence of autism prevalence in the general population.
I had a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw of clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse was a lot.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or <unk> <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in <unk> and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody realize these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to a paper published in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no one translation of the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he was talking German, and he <unk> him for her.
The document offers a alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic integrated with a school boarding school in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music exercises with music, and children kept their games on Sunday, the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's of life that required the <unk> <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces during the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, and I called them their little teachers, and it started to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
Now, Asperger's has seen autism as a continual diverse array that ranged with an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He went beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, some autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s in the '90s, their changes were entering <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a wide range and <unk>
These changes were not in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked in the <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before I went out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents from everybody knew what autism was.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first difficult clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in criteria and the introduction of these trials created a web effect, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it was that it was, <unk> that people with autism and their families will ultimately support the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to <unk> vaccines for the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> credible story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart rate that one of 68 children in America are on the spectrum, it's right now, the autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, other autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they're the puzzles for solving by the new technological advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way of understanding <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
Certainly people -- they have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, community communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence forms on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
