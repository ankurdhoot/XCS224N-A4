You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, I read more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can do it as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and you never have chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that you fell somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple back to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle of the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I went to bleeding every week in the bathroom bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the medical room.
I was doing it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> years, I felt the need to start working in organizations that were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that adults never get to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man to you that I know you've been found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to tell you with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we went to <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> from his family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was made on itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked about a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water almost 60 feet away, and I couldn't even think that it was about a <unk> on another <unk> on a <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or they break the ice barriers.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people who refuse to <unk> and they hold up to the end, whereas others can't be able to get more and become a <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, largely as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is all the opposite.
As a <unk> melts I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As a iceberg, it releases rich water into minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors -- knowing that in these unique times there are only in that way and won't be there in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's very unlikely to get to see a <unk> iceberg here.
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg in size.
<unk> for about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every single <unk> a baby.
So two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too close to the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of it, I don't get to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined by the X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined by the X <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll get back to them later.
In my operating activity, I will play two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> for training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- so human bodies and <unk> how have the body fluid -- the idea of <unk> what have they thought about the body.
The other role that performance is in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins two people inside of a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of people with sex sex -- individuals whose physics would not fit in the male <unk> and conventional <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> embraces many different forms.
I'm going to put to you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't spread in the human forms of male or female.
For example, it's the case of the individual <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene is told to the <unk> that we all have in life that are going to be <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual has no receptors in testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops on a <unk> course <unk>
When you get the baby to <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl, it's raised as a child.
And often, it's not even until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is going on.
And then you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a Y.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, as men, as men, we have in the body of something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a woman who doesn't know his <unk> structure, I think it will be a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles that have the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old guy who was born and raised as a <unk> had girlfriend, she had a life as a boy and he had just found out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th 20th chromosomes and the uterus glands, they were so active that it essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component of the hormone component as the male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having the medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors found that in fact was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th century develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know what it happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> to surgery -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that they spread out to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy carries <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have an identity -- <unk> <unk> being a black means to say to have African anatomy in the historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born as two people inside of a body.
The most <unk> case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the fabric of their sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called them to wonder: "What a test will be done to determine whether you're <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that don't exist such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we need to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are we all drawing that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more goes through science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought were a stable <unk> categories that are going to be used directly with <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out a lot more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we get involved in science and more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the categories of the categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions in day -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never got to <unk> with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put up a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved it still not <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a consequence, we need to deal with a prisoner's dilemma actually death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion, a categories of categories could be happy to someone like me.
So in politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got nervous.
So I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
<unk> from the concept point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and kind of <unk> in what they did, that I find each other watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
The parents were <unk> it was for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they were doing, it was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And, as you all remember, what we <unk> our parents <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had a clear idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was being used by the freedom of blood from the grandfather to father and then the son, etc.
Parents -- <unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They took the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences -- that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they lined up a part of a <unk> system where two things were born.
It was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And there are very clear, if we look at the story of the Parents -- that many of them were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be transmitted by a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement of Human Rights movement.
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from <unk> <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people from color that we prescribe to <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start wondering why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> for anatomy.
I don't want to say that for the age of five years, they should be allowed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that I think we should be a sense of <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings who are <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine one of them, Mary, was three months before time: June 1, 1980.
So Henry, in the other hand, was born in term: was born on March one of March 1980.
For the only fact that we were born three months before Mary had been attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the heart of sexual consent -- the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that, not because it has a different age, but because he was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
As a man will be considered to be considered by virtue of being considered by virtue of being considered by virtue of being considered now is <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on their hand, does not have the same rights to same-sex marriage, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that are going to be <unk> that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy might be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go?
It seems like what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line in some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are trapped in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have a chromosome and that to marry a woman there is to have the Y.
Now, in practice they don't do tests by making people <unk>
But this is also very strange because the story I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do people judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I should do this for <unk> for people to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can be able to make more <unk> <unk> intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships than people of 40 to know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, perhaps with an MRI.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to bring this current of thinking relative to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as the Iranian person that a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless it's willing to have a change of sex -- in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon with which I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twins and then pick up and then pick up your fame.
But when the phone was asked to ask the operation from the operation -- he was a very glamorous operation -- he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of separation of <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people who are <unk> to change for the sake of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how it would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation at <unk>
And I want to say something a bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about group.
Since years ago, since I have been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
You know, what about women's <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing women in the <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, more than a <unk> something that there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that there are more likely to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that is what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect part, think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count in a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily address the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But it just was going to take away by buildings.
Imagine half of those who wanted to live in the apartments are already owners, and that in the other half you still supply to do that.
Could you try to increase the ability by making <unk> in all of the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that are around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building distractions and the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, build a moving apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place will rise the construction instead of putting it up.
So I proposed that governments -- new reform areas of reform big enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people were going to come up from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following presidential elections -- <unk> <unk> it would occur with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and the same time reconciliation.
He asked her to <unk> which was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most <unk> ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and listen to all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to the new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies as a norms of <unk> and usually the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a Guatemala a Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk was described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which <unk> the rules that will be <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me -- and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk again about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image of this one, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport just covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that would measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
<unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader approached the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained how it was -- that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that they could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with them to help us build and make the norms of the <unk> so that everybody could trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could be able to do easily about a thousand square miles.
And so soon after the 19 of January, I voted in Congress to <unk> the Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that would allow us to create these special developmental regions.
In a country I had just passed through this legal crisis, voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All of the parties, all the lights in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17th, passed again in another voting <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of 21 to 24 in February, a <unk> <unk> <unk> is to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center of the city that's building in Korea, it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years to get the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this in a practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and they would be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the last of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to move immediately to another place.
There's a million a year a year coming from Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job -- sometimes they're mothers who have to earn money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my <unk> friends, I was asked to say, "Thank TED TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to do a public confession -- and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and I was more recently, photographing and publish in my blog suits <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are <unk> usually my money is going to a good <unk> and my view is <unk> and buy it into my personal search for <unk>
So what am I going to find today?
I'm going to be from my size?
I would like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
So going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what you're going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring with someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of inner clothing and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is all I put in my <unk>
I imagined it would be able to find everything else that I wanted to use after you get here to <unk>
And because I don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in inner underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You almost always see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in a week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be about bad <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people in the right people, you don't just give you a little bit of <unk> you would too.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you go inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like I play <unk> or I remind them to her little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you see you well with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside you don't look at it that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a single personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and again when people came up with me this week simply by what they were using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously, all of this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, in Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need <unk> emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I'm <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive thing.
So, if you put a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where do your brain look like?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I believe that for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both of them <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is that it says that one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that play with that bar of parking lot, taught a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model of the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physics, because they don't play with <unk> parking with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point it was called the physics a few years ago; you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit themselves to my logical side.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't have been.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow show that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then here we do a good look at the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal little metal <unk> and that <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost in the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip chip with a new chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a kind of <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people are going up to you out of doing those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The partners in the journey of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that we <unk> and the wind that happens to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then we put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free from acting like him.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that it moved in very strange forms.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way that I <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which is expands and <unk>
And when we give it a soft signal, we were able to make it <unk> and that we didn't react at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing that was <unk> and they didn't go at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, every trillion trillion atoms that make up that metal piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and at the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, watch this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's my logical <unk>
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we get it, and we turned the lights up and look inside the box, we saw that metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics says that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep <unk> of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that he is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 and 18 months.
A lot of stories and stories, it was going to take it with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining to just on this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> from a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I'm trying to do the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
So better to show you the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from his launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the <unk> gallery MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, in the <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click on and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move out there and get off.
Would you want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click bit, we jumped inside.
They're inside, they want to go to the end of the hall,
continue to go ahead and go on.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't got the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information about <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click right here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the technology <unk>
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there's a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
And I found that kids were actually playing something.
I was a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which consists of hitting a <unk> with a stick, the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further down and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you'll see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump back again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how they're Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and it really goes up and it really does.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night, I think I'd never seen it like it before.
Let me show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is really great. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that day.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very easy, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of the <unk> -- we just cheated around it.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, it even also comes from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium is to do justice to their art work, and it's represented in line.
And the great question I'm doing today is this: "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I've got something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
We call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian, <unk> all the children in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened a very interesting thing in the racing racing in the last two decades.
And then some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula One, take a budget and do it to a good pilot and a good car, a good car.
And if the car and the pilot and the pilot were good enough -- you made the career.
This is what in engineering -- in engineering, it was <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're going back to the free air.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can tell you that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
More than cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition from <unk> <unk> for the purposes at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms to become sensors and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> <unk> the <unk> he says he took the hammer and he threw it into the Moses -- they actually still can see a little dent in <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a very lucky summer in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of it, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at neural activity on the web.
Here's the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the evening early there are people around here, and there are doing so-called <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> of France.
<unk> people make a quick call on the bathroom.
Second time End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night they all went to <unk> the center.
So you see the great summit.
The next day they all came to the center of the <unk> team and the prime minister of then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, at the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city pulse in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a hint -- how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the garbage in their shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, you put it up to the garbage and then start <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're really complicated things that are complicated and lots of <unk>
But the other thing that we think we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we <unk> a day still follows there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and a lot of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked at the beginning, which is run on the environment.
And the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, join to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> tubes.
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels to be written in them, I'm going to show you patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it.
And <unk> a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors and no windows, but when you come up with it opens up so you can go through.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter, when they go down the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but that when it's low almost all the architecture goes away.
Here's how it works.
You see the people who are going on in the inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> the sensors that open up the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to let you happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and water holes and one had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physicists -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have small helicopters in the air and that each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw earlier, that moves with other in sync.
We could form this cloud, to form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, in which what it changes is the light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can reach, and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best favorite dancers of mathematics, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their motions in 3D and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the capture in different <unk>
It's so <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
It can make it all the movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels with the pixels to play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment as an oyster nursery -- like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, of the digital power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this can we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how will we move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in the collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered the pixels.
You can move around, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serve to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up as a new top of London.
You can get there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you might improve the <unk> for a more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better form, you have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of ourselves?
What about to live with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is it going to be <unk>
What would you like if they could choose something?
<unk> from Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people will choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me watch.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Oh, the majority. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference.
The great episode of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> in addition to the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology -- it makes sense to the light of the <unk>
But if they effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Does it mean other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, the one that interests us.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years old.
It might seem to be that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in its most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the <unk> more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> asked you about <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully controversial environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to want to be able to have no effort on it.
It's really as a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption in some rush <unk>
But by the other thing, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something perhaps better <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is as a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got it.
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in the multicellular organisms, each cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters of cells.
But when the organisms show up <unk> things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death by <unk> seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time he had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a gorgeous <unk> <unk> clothing.
He looks at him and says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, he says, George, I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to get it healthy.
I wanted to get health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about moving the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view of an evolutionary view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic charge to the next level, and then we're going to get to the sea.
I think all of the feeling that <unk> Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily nurture longevity.
They don't necessarily touch the biggest or the stronger or the most intelligent and even the most smart.
Evolution encourages the best creatures to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, <unk> fish in <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase, I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that they don't <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking is that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that we produce an evolution of traditional traditional type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would tell you that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when we kind of <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what they choose to the individual and familiar.
Just think that if it could be possible to be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or <unk>
You wouldn't want to do those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near 20,000 and a week.
It's not a lot of a lot to make the human genome to actually make the human genome for <unk> and be increasingly in the end of all.
They come up there.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can do viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to mandate against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against flu <unk> in cells from a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good about <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and <unk> or change the newborn egg, and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life to eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology, that same motor of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the <unk> <unk> of <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of machine <unk>
Why don't they have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions that would pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to <unk> a better society, more <unk>
Or, let's choose to selectively selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more uniform or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for evil, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight.
So they immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
And usually that's not the road.
And the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words have heard about it.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight professor.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't do it, all the fences I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, it has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington -- which was a lot of -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also turned to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I'm going to do in things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my wife with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, like <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14 <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, I'm not afraid of fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  --  And I scream, <unk> as a little kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point I turned to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle of not dying that day.
And they gave me another gift, which was the chance of looking at the future and going back and live differently.
You who are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be like this -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that you might expect to do because they think they're going to live for <unk>
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day came to her house after he ran and said, "Dad, I feel like a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, <unk> has complete paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation -- so obviously the graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he can be able to communicate with <unk>
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can be communicating through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be a very good person and you have a very good thing you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Someone to see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they go <unk> with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
And I joined with his brother and his father there at that very moment, <unk> okay, this is the <unk> Tony goes to a machine, and we're going to build a way to be able to do his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on your inner cannot be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer and you draw on that and record the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the attacks on Bush and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization and so much move things on one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of the insurance companies, and we got a machine that you could do it -- I could give a machine as a <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all the corner of all the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the <unk> and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and that when they were born, they would have taken off the walls of the walls and instead there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, <unk> we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sun <unk> we bought on the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera -- the <unk> we put it up on a light of LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds yourself, we published the <unk> code, the software is low for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital I can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was amazing.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this picture of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning two weeks of lessons of all night, Tony went back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and is looking through the support system of his life.
We ran out of the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall in the outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and took me out of there for me to be able to <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great thing, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we are trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it more fast and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The awards were in the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 major inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April this year in the <unk> <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show, which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you look at something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there was in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> <unk> technology I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we're going to find out with something that we feel like to do, if it's not now, <unk> and if I'm not me, who is <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years that are in situations usually very difficult and at the same time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- a fun thing in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been <unk> in situations in such horrible situations with the only thing to treat.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple weeks ago I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered the rights to the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I was doing was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and as content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it into ridiculous you or your company to do it.
But said that, it's a very good opportunity to do it.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked him a year ago, I couldn't have done it for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the world of the marketing world.
And as I said earlier, I've entered some horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be able to <unk> it could be so difficult or so dangerous as to enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tries to try to do a product -- the marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that all up on the bottom of the end, it has images in the end, all the time -- all the time -- from the title of the title, which comes before the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were going on to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X <unk> in the title, but we're going to make sure that we will make all the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe you get a shoe -- and it becomes the most cool shoe you've got to <unk>
The most cool car you've ever led to "The largest <unk> never <unk> the best drink than you had <unk> <unk> of "The largest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- and we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea of the whole idea, the whole shot of end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- that's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't know how <unk> it is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half and a half million <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth taking a couple of big events.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film comes out of the film is going to look like a bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be helpful.
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought that <unk> was going to have a conversation from the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one for one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of you wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of <unk> was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage scenario and the <unk> scenario is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that came up.
I like a way of <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> even <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it's trying to make it something it changes suddenly.
But why? Well, the transparency gives <unk>  like that rare bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to tell you that we want to be <unk> history.
We want it to be a story, but we want to have a story, but we want to make it <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in a lie -- and there's him looking at me, as he used <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the story <unk>
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just one company, a agency wants to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to remove the argument and go to business and go to companies myself.
So what I started to see is all of a sudden -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge giants and others that make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make films of Hollywood movies say that the reason why their films are so successful is because the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big films of <unk>
And film is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I get out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone I can say "Are you very cool for this <unk>
Are you ready? You see a little <unk>
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there it offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> as <unk> as <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a solid, <unk> to <unk> <unk> as it is.
That's the big look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are more well a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people to people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you want to describe in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep you fresh on, more <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those things that are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, to people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, so many gray colors, and things like that.
I usually wear it as a <unk> or like <unk> or like the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman Woman 2: In part <unk> partly <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the guy guy.
They had toys for pets, in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a brand <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand of Tom <unk> but I often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could enter my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way.
MS: These are a way to be able to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I believe that your world is the world that we <unk> like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things. I like the weird things.
A: Tell me about <unk> what does that matter?
What's the <unk> What phase <unk> you find now?
Why is it important? <unk> What's the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about it.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to have fear. What kind of coaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: thank you for your patience. Great <unk> <unk> Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness on all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox on them.
And I believe that some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to avoid the things that are not going to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are like this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are now <unk> marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come and come up but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: It's a <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to take your identity in a brand, your personality phone, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful as being playful as <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or audacious <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystical <unk>
Or are you rather <unk>
You're conscious as a <unk>
Are you established, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Are you <unk> stable, familiar -- safe, sacred sacred, or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use the MRI <unk> to identify the centers of the desire in the brain for commercial marketing as a movies.
We went to San Paulo where it's forbidden with the <unk>
Every city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there is no <unk> there is no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the way in schools with money in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the biggest answer or the most successful that I've had more success is those in which I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> taken to their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They had success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk>
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press and TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has started to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talk about to <unk> their customers will not be part of it.
I have always believed that if you get <unk> if you take risks, that there are opportunity.
I think when you get people out of that's pushing it to failure.
I think when you train their employees in relation to the risk of the risk is preparing their entire company for <unk>
I feel like what it has to happen to us is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not going to be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we'll move forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear -- <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today, more than a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And I said this with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So <unk> on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization, the Foundation, Foundation a check for <unk> to be applied to my own TED overnight.
The idea behind the worm computer <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant plant <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software is a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a <unk> effective virus in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a social <unk>
<unk> enter the gray, <unk> <unk> and the <unk> nuclear program, is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> <unk> as a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that you're trying to infect is actually working on that place: in that place: in the <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant in the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out of the attack, and we found that he was <unk> in two bombs -- a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
Do all of the dots that can attack.
You probably even know how much it would take the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at in the beginning is called the system of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and trying to get it to the real world, with the real real real world.
We need <unk> theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant plant <unk> and to the <unk> <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the great digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
And it wasn't like this -- it wasn't like this.
The results have been from two weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would be, to one single goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we have determined that we have determined the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you a few very interesting things that we just saw, I really hated me.
There's the grey box, and up there you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the values of the sensors for example, the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which still runs during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data are <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the large turbine turbine goes on the speed, you have to open away valves.
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can get bad things.
The plant can explode.
And I don't have the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms for <unk>
They were the most possible.
And if you made that, with what you think about is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to face the consequences and better than we begin to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main thing behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower <unk>
There's one itself, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can take and give <unk> abilities, or another one that makes users of lawn chairs and turn back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force -- which also increases your speed, and helps you for example, to handle it.
It's actually the actual integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect it with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a <unk> charge of a 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to get more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries on your back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to it.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human Rights <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can <unk> 90 pounds on the way for many hours.
Its flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and play with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then you get my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the look at users of chairs.
There are 68 million people in <unk> chairs in the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with very often, people very young people, with damage to their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be the only option.
We also talk about the population that develops them very quickly.
His only choice, a lot of times -- by a brain injury or something else.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago in the neocortical column, and as a result was unable to go back to walk for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got some sensors there.
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the TV computer, here on the back.
There are some batteries that give up the motors in the <unk> and in the knees, and they make it progress with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a stranger jump in the air, skiing down down <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all of the movement of <unk>
Little time later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
It stole me to the last couple of hope for my self.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs the bottom of <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: So you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just from soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the chairs of chairs of chairs to everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, to know his cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of the rainforests of Congo.
The Bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest living relatives,
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known to their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done a lot of emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the Bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by the big guys, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very dangerous society where the death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario in a violent conflict that has been prolonged for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction is also going to put the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and deforestation are making you not can fill in or a stadium with the Bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as the apes -- the <unk> not the <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behavior, diversity in connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the very <unk> roots of laughter, dance and human ritual <unk>
The game is the glue that came together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> style, and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> has <unk>
Just that I think in this case to him, I love him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common as much in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because I think this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing things unusual as a game -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways that are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to show you, this is <unk> a young female man, who is playing with a <unk> water.
I think that, as it is, sometimes we played themselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds inside and outside.
And this playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a world increasingly difficult with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But let me do the most of our perceptual capacity.
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at the least appropriate play, you can be the moments in which it is the most urgent thing.
So for that, fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a fire body volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers belong to a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a fairly high chance of going to go.
But there was still a race against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what this was our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that had just come back before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- came up to the captain and he asked him to go out and would save the dog owner of the owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people who walked into a <unk> building to save a live alive just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to get in the house.
I need to be <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but I was going to put it up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firefighters that at that height or less had finished off the fire and walked into the main room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and the precious dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house with the house owner where, as I was waiting for, his trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the house owner of the house <unk> for the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that someone had reached him even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer <unk> I'm witness to volunteer -- I'm a witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also in <unk> <unk> and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they're in <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind myself to remind you to know.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get it now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but each day we're going to influence someone's life.
So they trained to the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea, <unk> modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
He was called, <unk>
And in a few years, the building blocks came to every home.
It's estimated that there have been more than 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> did it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would lead us from a world of <unk> <unk> stacked to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the block of concrete, the transistor allows you to create a much larger and more complex and more complex one, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are quiet to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics every one with specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they put together through magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
The bricks have a code of colors.
The green is the lens, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So there's only to assemble one blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make larger circuits.
A blue blue is producing light.
Can we put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, which is here, and now we have a light <unk>
So we <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having that program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures, very simple.
To make it faster or slower or slow down just to get this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is an increasing collection of it.
We want all the interactions in the world to become ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to kids to play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why the door of an elevator lift it open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also have led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics start to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>   A few weeks ago we took <unk> designers from the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island who has no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Do you do something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a barrel of <unk> on the movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that has a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So I go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is seeking to engage with the environment in focusing on the environment.
Economic collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I've got a term time time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like some <unk> Peace <unk>
We had a few members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World, we send them the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk> employees worked with them.
His task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if you were looking at a quote, but what you really search for is that somebody has to clean up with the snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to help from this so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment <unk> a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that citizens will <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you did, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can do it.
I mean, it has a players' task.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology of government <unk>
And it spreads into viral form.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this app realized that I could use it, not for snow, not for snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> <unk> but people steals their batteries.
That's why he asks the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that would use using using it.
And this has <unk> <unk> in organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology you'll know that this doesn't happen yet.
The data acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done by normal channels there would be taken at least two years and side two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the California <unk> power of California that the time has 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there's projects like this in every level of government.
So a application that would be program in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot shot in the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways of working, not as in private companies, as many people think that it should be.
Nor is a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
That is, without constraints, in the open way and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a <unk> institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to engage together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
They've not been given to the government.
Do you feel a great frustration in front of that, but you don't have the <unk>
And this people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings of the politics of politics, row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> <unk> "What we do together because they weren't alone <unk>
Now a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics doesn't recognize the government.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from us -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way we think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was thinking that the government was to choose people to <unk> <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, about <unk>
This is the health care center of services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you make a brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. He started with animal control.
And then he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music very strong and see if you were <unk>
And so it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston is not a center of calls.
It has a <unk> and mobile, called <unk> <unk>
You don't get that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk> <unk>
And one day, this really really has this <unk> <unk> in my cube of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make it <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report, he said, "I'd come to the place, I found the cube out of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good evening, sweet evening.
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to the distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to become <unk> and help others.
So, one citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected to two people.
And it could have connected to government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another another, <unk> the communities.
If we call control control, that costs a lot of money.
One major thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people think about it, but they think it's the entry of the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will bring our values to our values and make our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like a massive ocean and politics is the superficial <unk> <unk>
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But this is that <unk> that holds us out of that that belongs to us that we financed as something that is going on, that other thing, and in a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make bureaucracy that bureaucracy it sexy.
Because that's where the real government work happens.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report from 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for the ones that we have faced with government, is time to ask us what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we need to go to the institution that can act on the name of <unk>
We can't get rid of government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function so that it can spread <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> only is that we have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, <unk> I'm a more generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> they're all going to talk about.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
And so when the government problem is, they don't care about making your voices.
They're using your hands.
They get the work to the work to program applications that make better to work better.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> out of <unk> taking out a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody else, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all of us together, will be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons in jails and in the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in law practice -- my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in every conversation in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery to <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was a tough thing, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approaching and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I would give me again and if he said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get your time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight  nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at him, and I was like, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, went through the room, and he said, "Come on, <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "All right, <unk>
She said, "Now I <unk> I didn't get it, I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you do?"
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "I want you to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell you, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> this is what you did.
And then he told me, "I second I want to tell me about is that you're always going to do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I am."
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want to tell you about is that you never get <unk>
And I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> this is what you did.
I grew up in the field, in the South town, I have a brother a older year and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14  15, 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and went to the forest.
We only get the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> you know, <unk> and you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister also. <unk> a <unk>
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What is there? Take a <unk>
I went on the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, it's not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tell all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this spread <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I say it by the power that the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to the other that they really don't see sense.
We can't get them to do things that you don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died from alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we needed to <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate of <unk>
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my mind, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities, poor or black communities, it is so much <unk> so much reliable despair, by these facts.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, in 50 to 60 percent of all the young people of color are in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a criminal system that makes you much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is affecting the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not our problems.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting to me.
We're looking at our work in some very good developments with a good <unk>
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you know, in other states, you know, you know, you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years, the loss of copyright loss will be as high as it was before they had the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where the children were passed to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no possibility of getting out of it.
Right now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Let's give people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you have to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by <unk> crimes, but we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
Death death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent and liberated from the death <unk>
An innocent rate was an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never be able to ever fly airplanes if they were nine to <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on the history of history, I talk about slavery.
I'm talking about terror, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction of the reconstruction of the reconstruction of the reconstruction of the <unk> to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a very bad time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined their lives.
Now there are more people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell the talks, you ask people to stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with terror, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously about segregation and decades of racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time <unk> each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome the racial segregation without the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's very disturbing to listen to what you would do.
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
<unk> will never be keeping it here."
The room was silently and a lady said, "There's no way that we have our story, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> and we had to run the people."
Let's go through this.
How do we believe in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were in most <unk>
We couldn't get it out.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these things, so good things and wonderful they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are driven by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my mind, we need to integrate both of these things.
We're talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more <unk> with the basic challenges in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in some ways, something that is inside of us.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so <unk> so <unk>
With innovation, the development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering, we wanted the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, guidance for the spirit, a willingness to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There's no <unk> <unk> technology and design, which allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> I called me -- to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. Be do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was like, <unk>
So I was going and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about death penalty for death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and at the end of the end and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got to put his finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find a way to deal with these challenges, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst thing that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't worry, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who have to be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's how it isn't.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> it doesn't judge us from our technology, because of our design and rational.
At the end of the end, you get the character of a society, not because of the way they treat rich and powerful rich, but because of the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I get too much force.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years old, which has been <unk> so they were being told as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge to turn someone into what it isn't it?
The judge would do it as an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late I was awake <unk> by God, if the judge can become something that you don't, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 <unk> a little, <unk> black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> which said, <unk> for my 14-year-old black man to be treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> I put there there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethical -- but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, there was not only <unk> but I had sent it to the cut.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And then finally, my God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car, and I was truly <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car. She walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he looked at me and he said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I came up and I was shocked.
And I was interested in the ear, to me.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, I was me." And we start here."
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that I had written those <unk>
<unk> the prosecutors <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and everyone's <unk> because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye, I got to see the <unk> that I was going and <unk>
I looked at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black -- in the face of concern, he walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> I showed you blessed because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up in foot, looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man to keep her sight in the target with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
What our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the present people who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious wish of the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that isn't a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to <unk> the funding that they spend today in the business policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases were not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to come up with the law to make the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to what you think is this?
<unk> actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not because of crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to chain to make people <unk> for stealing a bicycle, small crimes against property instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats by bin Laden.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be from the last six days or in the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than survive, the first stop of all of those data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and recorded all of the information looking for something in the environment that could make harm.
So for a <unk> of stories, to look at the negative.
That old adage of <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all of the digital devices provide us news, the seven days of week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe instead of change, what really happens is we got <unk>
Perhaps huge progress in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, extinction species, water scarcity.
As human beings are really good at <unk> the problems and in the long run, we just just went with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average income per capita income for inflation has been <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communication, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy is 25 to more than 80 percent of the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, no toilets, no <unk> television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It is a lot of this technology -- and then it's given exponential growth.
So my good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that was <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and double the performance of the price of about 12 months.
That's why the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer of the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
So I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and peace, in recession depression and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
<unk> in the cloud, which my friends are called infinite computing, sensors and networks, the 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on all over the planet, synthetic biology, energy, vaccines and digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory of Watson, a <unk>
It was spade.
I was looking at the newspapers the best headline that you would have.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can be able to affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about it, the fact that a group of students can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single day, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the State of Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as <unk>
He's tied up with oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
So let's try this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet that will be used by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about need, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents a hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the water now.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after country <unk>
<unk> a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, that two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology that's available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, I gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking drinking water to the day of any <unk> <unk> water, <unk> water, by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke has just agree that I'm going to do a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence in which this will be, Coca-Cola to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation by this technology.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the end world in the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile phone communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart cell phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and information that nobody could have predicted ever before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> video libraries and music, <unk> technology, <unk> technology, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when it comes to health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the Foundation, and something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device that they speak, and because he has <unk> they can get blood out of the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics that a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of 25 percent of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus, or DNA that didn't be able to call the health of health and, first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been able to do before we add to global conversation.
What are these people?
What do we find? What would you <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we have the highest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of <unk> and because of the use of impressions in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us 3,000 billion members of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
How about a few voices never before <unk>
How about if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What did these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small, guided equipment, guided by their passion with an objective of course, can do things -- things that were before they could only do big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that probably some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold the protein.
The crease determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university teachers among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined in and started <unk>
And it's shown today that the machinery of brain recognition machinery is better folding than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we today have more power to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are going to be told to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have over the front of the extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very famous idea.
The <unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they thought <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
<unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
I caught it up to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that's nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a world in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could do it.
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not from there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 millimeters -- the black beard <unk>
And the fishing fishery was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was made more than a half in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the number of fish had fallen down in half.
I went to five inches at the age of five.
They have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the decade, <unk> started in <unk> Europe made a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty good, he called the <unk> 4.
I went to fish on it, and we ran studies in the south of the Sea Sea South China and, especially in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And the majority of the fish are blobs of the tiny fish on some <unk> remains that are fish from coral reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The bottom background is a very solid background of soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a black <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to do it, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains that the fishermen are collected every time they go to a area where they have never fish.
But it wasn't <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
They took the start to start to start to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you think this happens something like this.
On the x-axis, we have things that are <unk> biodiversity, a lot of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and I extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the element of changes.
And at the end of the end you keep up with a <unk> remains.
And that, in great measure, it's we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very prevalent before <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous sea of great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as that captain such as a captain was going to see a lot of fish in this area that can't be used or, usually they don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
And from there the enormous role that can be a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we actually recreated the past.
So let's take the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people of the West, for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema maybe you can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay, 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were <unk> the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is to Cameron <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I look YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are made of viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was younger, that seemed very, very hard about it.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or from our actions, come together in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can get famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, only a small percentage is viral gets a huge percentage of visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Three of trends, communities and participation and surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the northern summer of last summer.
<unk> didn't say to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a rainbow of <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I've already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> that I was going to get to the <unk>
The creators of trends as Jimmy <unk> present things and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's on Friday.   Everybody wants to start on Friday.   Everybody wants to get the end of week, the weekend --   <unk> on Friday. <unk> on Friday.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science was one of the first people to do a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of trends take a view of view and share it with a larger public audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this big internal joke and then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know there's a <unk> version of three million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of the old one.
And then it became international land.
Suddenly, there was a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we can all be in part of it.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What do you want to have written this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video per minute, only the only thing and unexpected can be able to figure out how these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of <unk> <unk> in New York City, I admit I didn't really interested in a lot.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> but often there are a obstacles that are made to you <unk> by <unk>
KA: Thank you the effect of surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million to see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth all the new thing that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend today, creative communities of participation, and totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- in which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, <unk> <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't hear permission to express your ideas.
Now we are all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media -- it's hardly the current media, but we are monitoring the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose whole life had been supported in the single single unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been completely in vain.
The words for a long time friends, now I'm going to do it.
They lie in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed to forget his story.
My task was not to let that been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that history tried to <unk> but it <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the dawn of <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life was destined to be used to a <unk> task, the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat flies into the sea as a little <unk>
Every adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the <unk> rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we were <unk> first we took my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the dying engine and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I did, given for the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants on.
Unlike the middle class suburbs that existence <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of right.
The smells that come from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English is <unk> between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
All of dollars were <unk> and he formed an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what he should be <unk> who was usually <unk> it was always <unk>
Two <unk> pairs for school, one to hide the holes on the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home, where?
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were focusing on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares are in order to be able to be able to get it.
She opened a computer store, and then studied to be <unk> and opened up another business.
And women would come with their stories on men who couldn't make the transition and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> boys in between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and ran out.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, I was the <unk> <unk> <unk> with what I was talking about myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, increasingly, <unk> by violence, drug abuse and insulation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of Law, I was elected the young Australian young one.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but your edges don't <unk>
As <unk> resident bicycle <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and activist and social activist invited to speak in places that I had never heard of, and in houses that she'd never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the labs and the happy life in a suburb -- <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age as she had when we get the ship.
He hadn't been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What are you not going to be what you didn't know.
So I talked about <unk> <unk> and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly, I was talking, to talk about it to talk about.
I met people from all the paths in life, many of them doing what they were doing, living on the boundary of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
It had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger a <unk> new to the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that being grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, that the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They were not <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy out there, a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people who have the motto cannot be <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant sample of soup that all <unk>
<unk> to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but a few brilliant ones, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared about.
Life had no changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
By 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and it was a lot more <unk> caused when I won.
The can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw it on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why her hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you've taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
They've never been <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because of those who we were and how life built us now we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have been <unk>
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that to you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy to the right.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, <unk> brave in every wave, the constant pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them safe and see them safe would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of how it's now here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I <unk> the great prince of prince had Indian warrior -- he had <unk> taking a bow and a <unk> to the ground, he collected water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very excited to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I got this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic to <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones have to luxury and the cameras prevent it to be <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I <unk> I came to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
It was <unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw an storytelling device that can connect to the readers of the world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where we are.
You put the text with the image, the image, the sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what does that matter?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I read a character from the book.
In a few moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that it comes led to me.
My little inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that were <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned out.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release firefly fireflies.
And they actually light your way into what it subtraction from the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
And so here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all fantasy book, there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect of me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people were out of India -- they know their counterparts -- <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we need to go out the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> rocks, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this entire childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, you have to get a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between magic and the Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you get out with the iPad, and the video is on and through a augmented reality and can actually augmented it sees a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants in the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves it.
And you have to do the sound of wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and the magic and technology is coming to each other.
We have the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves in the natural world and the natural world and the child love that I felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they have no longer that we stopped listening.
This is my scale. This is a very simple thing.
It has a turn of it on and closed <unk>
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got a challenge to get 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my medical doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem, not at the same time in which it needs to be <unk> or any urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week, being available on.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were taking care of their homes, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to recover control and to be captains and it can also help care of health because of the challenges that we face as the firing of the costs of attention to <unk> <unk> and other issues.
And these are techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but you can do it by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share it with you with a video with a video.
We all have navigation controls in <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find potential food chains fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked it, but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get <unk> saving lives right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public crowd -- you see a <unk> please <unk> where, and when it's open, because they sometimes open up in <unk> and other ones are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks will use their cellphone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to take it on the world level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They could be messaging or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> which is still in its place.
Please <unk> in this and not just the health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, it's photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my previous passion from the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera that process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk>
To me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when you press the <unk>
<unk> like this one: a <unk> <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures as dark as dark and colorful at the time but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I mean <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way as a photograph.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that we want to capture a moment.
But what's the trick that makes them seem real.
Is it the details or <unk>
Put light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way you can create something that still seems like <unk> as if you were there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain because the brain doesn't follow the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're not even <unk> the things that are around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs it is very important -- because otherwise something looks wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to get realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect child.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part is <unk>
But this image is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
And in the personal point, I think it's easier to create a place that would find it -- because you don't need to put the ideas in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a dry <unk>
And yeah, I even made a red house at the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So for a realistic outcome I think it takes for planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the results the result can be very beautiful and at very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
If you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a folder from mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
It's a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, each step here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves -- it's new.
Here's something strange here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn into the lights.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do you look at technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw it on a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to get to you the diagram would look ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you ask for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology as fast as the <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go down to that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development of an increase that every single few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at this -- look at these <unk> curves -- we see that they don't continue to forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or will it be a typical <unk> <unk> I know this until it comes up to something totally different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, a new way.
And so what I'm trying to ask, is that what is that new way that you adopt the world?
What new state is going on the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has spent year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
That happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that I extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The time scale in which I'd like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every one billion years.
So we go back about a half two billion years when the Earth was a large sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that were going around them.
If we look at the way that those chemists <unk> we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that, at that time, I was floating around with some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes on it.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to bring out of the outside of the outside and the drops drops to them.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> mobile forms of the oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you get older, you get a chemical distribution of the chemicals that <unk>
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time of adding the chemical <unk> <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, life -- a very simple chemistry, but things are really interesting when these drops the trick of abstraction.
In some ways we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since that evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that kind of writing.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here's 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people's airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the ordinary letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If I was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years ago.
But then another big step happened in which things became very different -- and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information by forming the cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate.
This communication led to the communities that, in a way, they were together in that way, and a set of <unk>
It would be <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community became more and more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up with so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community board by a DNA chain.
The next stage interesting for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as one organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't really act alone.
The skin cell is no longer from the heart, or the one of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something that we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These began to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
It's <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those communities were built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learning not to eat some fruit because I knew evil and sick last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit program.
So the fact that the nervous system built out those structures of information to save the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now occur to an individual.
It could happen in the time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals figured out the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea a very complicated idea in your head.
I'm here to sit here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated that we become sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we started doing <unk>
We now spend through periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on, it's the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of history that I told you took a billion years each.
The next stages of the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The following, the language and so on, they took less than a million years old.
And beyond, like electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion.
We see the process <unk>
But I get my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer technology.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead of <unk> designers, <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that we didn't get on, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions on the <unk>
You could run these instructions on random instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take the ones that we are going to do what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely to be random random sequences.
But one, luckily, was able to find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that you better did the <unk>
They were going to get them to the rest of them.
And now we would argue that the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> the process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will have the properties of both of both programs.
So we got a new generation of <unk> programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
And they would take some mutations together.
And it tries again and tries again with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that were testing numbers in a absolutely perfect way.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to take them to see how they work.
They are red <unk>
But they meet the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety that they achieve because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
Once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at an analog time when we have been <unk> when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've got enough time to let me give up part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of course, <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and to use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talk about 300, a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the field of game without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to do it to the first base -- not to get time, and the second base will be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone than 10 <unk> you get four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League League League player in running more 400 bumps on a regular season.
Now let's ask this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what you tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place coming up and a wanted to have two clogged arteries and their family doctor is derived from a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 percent.
But you know something?
She's getting quite improving this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask them.
What do you think must be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a heart surgeon or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, <unk>
And the truth of the issue is that nobody else knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is sending me into the world, and I would lie to me with the mandate to be perfect.
I would never, ever do a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medicine.
I was a wise student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied of a blood test.
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence of the General <unk> at Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnostic diagnosis and the usual <unk>
And even known the diagnostic diagnosis of how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you put it all, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to the everything, because I would tell you about the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the emergency lady to the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to go to a cardiologist -- I was looking at that patient.
It would inform the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which gave me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart leaves and instead of pump the blood forward, and the blood goes to the lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I would love him.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on their heart.
I gave him <unk> food pills so that he could get out liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't wake up the phone, and I didn't do what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to deliver <unk> information.
Maybe I did this for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident who will pay constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> who could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it home, I didn't know a voice in my inside that would say, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it.
In fact, I was so safe that I asked her to the nurse to <unk> the <unk> <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think I'm going to be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was paralyzed and the ambulance with the ambulance took them to their home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I got to leave the hospital, and I walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. And I did something I don't do normally, at the time.
I went through the emergency service of the way home.
And there another nurse, not the one that I was talking about earlier, but another one told me three words, those three words that most medical emergency medical doctors.
Other specialists are also afraid of it, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: it remembers you?
<unk> the patient he sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I came back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of having come to her house, after I gave him the tall, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance who brought them into the emergency room with a blood pressure pressure from <unk> which means a severe shock of it.
I just barely breathe and it was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and waiting for the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days, it was obvious that he never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together together.
And in eight or nine days, it would be <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left him to go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The few weeks later, I would tell you about that and experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt single, <unk> without feeling that healthy healthy because you can't <unk> with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I'm talking about is what makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure that I would take the things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept following those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did we choose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in a day he <unk> the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me with myself in which if you were going to do the efforts to be perfect for not making more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an art department in the emergency hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
I was offered penicillin and sent him to her home.
But as he ran to the door, he was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my head asked me to talk to me in his office.
And I gave the three words: He remembers you?
It reminds the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and he had no <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but from the top, top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, he didn't die.
You get <unk> antibiotics by going <unk> and recovered at the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again and again.
Two times on the same turn of the emergency <unk> I didn't get <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially to work in a hospital, because they were going to have 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
And we had an X-ray of kidneys -- but it turned out -- a colleague of kidneys that I was checking the patient -- some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was very much diarrhea.
I read him liquid order to <unk> and asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it up and to see some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and recovered well.
But every case I was passionate about, I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant people have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and no support.
And here's the problem: If I can't get it, and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you show this to them that they don't make the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my <unk> hospital, the wrong leg -- trust me that he would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total death of the mistakes.
It is the system where there are two <unk> who make mistakes and what wasn't, what they can't sleep and the ones that I know; they have <unk> results and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to people who make mistakes, will be safe to us.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about <unk> and medical journalism, I've made a personal study of bad medical health and errors medical errors to learn as possible, from the first article that I wrote to the Toronto Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one of 10 drugs will happen in the hospital that one of 10 drugs will be wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where gender infections are increasingly and more <unk> crawling chaos and death.
In this country, they die <unk> <unk> for medical errors <unk>
The U.S. Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going to take up every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in his chest, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
So the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals likely to error, well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk> cases.
In my <unk> white art, it's already a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell you, from the ambulance to the head of <unk> to the head of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah, <unk> "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> to go down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The [unclear] doctor is human, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to be trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They get their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way of <unk> and for support that they are all <unk>
And he works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make errors back in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a medical doctor.
I am a human <unk>
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three <unk> <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we took a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to choose a half a half a half a half a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research for a week to a group of companies.
So researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time that they are going to do in making decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
All of all, every job was involved very many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required for an hour or more of his time.
Now think about their elections.
Do you know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How does it make the way that it manages those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> the very, very glamorous level at least at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a park in <unk>
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water, and this was when we had water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asked for a occasion, I asked myself, why don't I buy nothing?
This is the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and said, <unk> this strategy of offering all of these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists full of the day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had <unk> different classes.
<unk> a post to <unk> right at the store.
We put up there with six <unk> or 24 different flavors and look at two different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what do people were willing to stop <unk> <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 percent of them when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
When he stopped when there were only three percent of us to buy <unk>
When I had six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six, that if they were in 24.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> <unk> probably <unk> <unk> -- less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of <unk> <unk> affects us in <unk> decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when we don't get rid of it.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for the retirement of about a million Americans, in between a million Americans, in the entire country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of funds available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program will save people to save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans to go from two to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of <unk> funds had less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that would offer about 60 funding, the rate of participation went to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those people who decided to participate, the more it was the number of choice, more people will become more likely to avoid actions or investment funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the financial well-being future.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they make the decision, the decision, even though this is going against us self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it will be better.
The main reason is that we want to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparing them to contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, unless it's more.
People always care when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you decide to be able to be able to cut, get rid of weird <unk> there will be a <unk> increase in sales, you will have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> became <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> greater sales and under costs.
You know that those today at average, at average, offer 45,000 products.
In a <unk> store, you have about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce in tin.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged from how to handle better is the author of David <unk> <unk> program.
Every Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safe fund of life.
Who really wants to choose, they give them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
They know that people often say, "I don't know how <unk>
They are all choices.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if their employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I talked to <unk>
He told me it would be willing to offer people in this audience a vacation with all paid the world's most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take your <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Any one who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first turn, that in the second time, but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images were made more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the <unk> of choice which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must be feeling very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or debit cards that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem to be real.
It turns out to make it be more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
So we did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
So that meeting is that we were looking at exactly as <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that you would get to the staff that you would think about the positive things that I would get in your lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or in what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
What we saw is that in the supermarket cannot, along the corridor <unk> the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But know?
Because the classification indicates to me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
Turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This chart is totally useless.
The categories must tell you something to <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
I'm supposed to tell you who they're <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we thought, if just a little bit.
We need to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision -- you buy a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that enables us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
I have 56 percent outside of the car.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order of the order of the decisions.
So half of customers are going to go from a lot of options, 56 colors, at a few hundred boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How do you get there.
If you get <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that are going from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go out of a few options in many, they are still there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order of the order of the information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice of change is not saying nothing about the preferences of <unk> interior, in all ways you're making us to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building now is more <unk> in the process.
To sum up.
I've been talking about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we can do it <unk> <unk> we can drive more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques I've presented to you, were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are working.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more careful to be in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the '30s in East East Germany, if you had a typewriter I had to write to the government.
So I had to record a picture of text by written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of texts.
If you found a written written with the wrong message, you could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would do -- the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, if you buy a laser printer from any large laser printer and you print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow printed dots on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you a pattern of one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> and etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal means by illegal media by stealing money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a computer <unk>
The secret service of America -- two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know her <unk>
And I say today is more likely than any of us will be a victim of a real <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most conservation crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them, they motivate them.
And groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a big role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals that do for money, <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the U.S. governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the collapse of the last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and offered a <unk>
Last week, I asked her in a meeting with representative government, asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die of a heart attack.
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except for a foreign foreign authority.
And they gave birth <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters the headquarters for the secret police police in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Between those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was a notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools for <unk> the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 40,000 euros to the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to government governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago was found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspected in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
You get the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be confident in our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to do today, will be forever.
<unk> die in any future future, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
Here's where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate to outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead as bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up with a lot of <unk>
They were dying are warriors that protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there is so few in Yellowstone National Park.
A child in my community, in the age of six to the nine years old, is responsible for the gained of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions were scary.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because even helping lions see the pen away.
I didn't give me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I was trying to trick lions to believe that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were told, but they said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I discovered that lions are afraid to the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with one switch that will turn off and shut down the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
They got everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, <unk> you get out there, because that's where lions.
And that's how you see male lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got to have trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and wondering if I could put the lights up.
I said yes.
The <unk> you can see at the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now by all Kenya, to freak out to other predators like lesbian, <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants as well.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise money and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was only a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes, and he told me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture the exciting thing that's listening to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You are working on the other electrical inventions.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close to electric <unk> One near <unk>
<unk> I know that you already invented electric fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, a time, right now, right now, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I had tried a <unk>  CA: The foot of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to be <unk> in every step that I would ask my friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we will come up with all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought that would happen all my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That he said, "When we <unk> the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last couple of weeks.
We're putting together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very isolated.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead, in the street, holding a child in her arms in his arms looking at the face of his mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine famine <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequent <unk> and all around me was completely in dark at night except by the lights in China, just by crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I would see bodies floating on the river, in time.
I can't reveal the details of how I left out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee refugee camps.
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because the refugees North China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested when I was arrested for the Chinese police, and I was blown away in the police station.
Someone had been accused by being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it doesn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking at asylum <unk>
But many can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there were eventually released to be released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to be lucky to get a lot of other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all of his world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity -- I've decided to pick up the South Korean going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much larger challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call with my pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started to study for the school exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and as punishment, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way for freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in some way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
And he asked you all of us and started asking you questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance of the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to go between the <unk> office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man thought, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, he explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and get them out of prison.
I read him with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the people who were getting more about it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community is really the rays of hope that the people are <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But the freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with some money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in English language, the practice of work, and more.
We can also act like the bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us follow in contact with family familiar, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Center.
This is Center -- <unk> stores of <unk> fast food, <unk>
So the planners of the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center so that represents something else, so they changed to Los Angeles as if this <unk> what is actually wrong with the city.
This is Los Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center for the food places to carry and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles South Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I was going to see that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you get out of home, you see the effects of the current food system in your <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And then I got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and go back to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a band of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters x three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, since I was my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to run it up.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we set up and we started planting our food forest -- trees -- you know, the nine complete vegetables over.
What we do, we are a kind of <unk> paid <unk> made by gardeners of all the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone <unk>
The city looked at me and <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that he had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court order to plant food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, I am."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> Green members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why do the hell don't seem like this?
<unk> a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> would give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, they grow your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there, <unk> my children there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I was growing my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the ground, like a piece of canvas, and plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
They were <unk> to see what land can do if they let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that's a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a education tool, from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the land.
It's <unk> to see how it affects the guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember a time that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night, and they were in my yard, and they were out in my backyard,
And I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes not temes that people will steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh my God, I don't have no fear that you're going to get to <unk>
That is in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to hold your <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me to download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had affected and how they used to plant with their mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer.
If kids are growing up, they were eating <unk>
If you grow <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if none of this is going to tell you, if you don't teach how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're busy seeing the kids of color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are being thrown out of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and convert them into healthy.
I don't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because it's free not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work on people, pull the kids on the street, to know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You know, <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is the weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, you know, if you want to meet me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we could plant something.
campaign. Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> from the <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very good road at all.
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days as today, as it rains a lot.
They can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if they're <unk> on your bike, and these cars go, that's not very nice.
And asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a silent road in a silent road.
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is <unk> a material that we use right now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, it has pores and water can happen through it, so all of the rainwater flow down the sides and will have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water anymore.
Noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road on the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface.
So first a stone, then you get more and more and more and more and more, and so on, you don't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> is <unk> and if they were <unk> they're going to become <unk> and <unk> from the <unk>
So, if you drive on the road, you will take the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about materials in <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool from steel, from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the wool out of steel in very small pieces and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one that you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is heating the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are moving back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, that I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried many samples there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 feet of the <unk> freeway, where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road is going to last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then we put it with our <unk> machine, and we took it back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers incorporating these fibers, using the power of steel, incorporating these fibers, in the surface of the road, you can even double the life of the surface of the road, and they can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this works.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to be cool first before I can show you how to touch it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the <unk> sound in my house.
My father was listening to News <unk> on his little, gray radius.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at those time, because the news usually was <unk>
"The Taliban would <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and they made illegal girls to be at school.
For the next five years, I was reminded of as a child to <unk> my older sister that I couldn't be used to be able to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that nobody could suspect where they were <unk>
We had to hide the books on the market bags so that it looks like the shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us came up in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Instead of once in a while, the school suddenly was suddenly for a week, because the Taliban were <unk>
We always wondered what they knew from us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you are."
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. It was in which their daughter, my mother, was to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
He went back two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not to educate her children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there was moments that I was very frustrated about our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can try to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So, you still want to do not <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He didn't only get rid of my university degree, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I wear it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global commission of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what we <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the very strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, as the mine, <unk> for them, even though even in front of a opposition to <unk>
As <unk> it's not the real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter would go on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
And when you get to your house, you know, the phone, a voice noticed that if they kept sending his daughter to school, they would give him to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've figured out about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who said, there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were to school, remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks as different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And they would argue that these changes would not last much, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and a <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of it, I was going to do it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> and he resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since he broke the <unk> revolution inspired by the license of massive <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as a <unk>
A forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was <unk> it was a great revolution.
Women and men were <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the every of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a courage to meet the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and a few loss of about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of society is <unk>
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a massive transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation, and the national reconciliation of the country.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with one single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about development development and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the <unk> Women of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, <unk> <unk> to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and the right of our <unk> participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> than the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was accepted and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first election for 52 years.
However, soon at little, the elation of the elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found out of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their predators, copyright rights of prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up a <unk> mindset -- and it's been away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to <unk> with our story of success for the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I am here today to say that we, as a nation, we choose evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and <unk> <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as well as women as for women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the choices that we need the elections, which only <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of the women who need the <unk> and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage as agents and call out of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also put it into practice <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration in place of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> by the war, desperately desperately in the end of reaching peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between women's <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in a existential way before they do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God's <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> that is known in all the traditions -- the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> that embraces all of the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the towns have been <unk>
And so the same thing as the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine extracellular matrix of compassion <unk> all the existence.
This is how he tells us "My mercy for all things."
This is how he tells us "My <unk> mercy on my <unk>
They are going to be <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a fanciful question: who has an equally <unk> response.
This is the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that they all do -- why is she left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times -- the man, that I believed my soul <unk> I was blown away from my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man who loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times as I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a zero-sum trap.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical domestic violence of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> of Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> among them Johnson & Johnson, <unk> <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I'm about 20 years married to my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all religions, all of religion, every income levels and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only is men, and domestic abuse, only happens in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that he would sit with a man who hits her and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence -- than other ages, and over 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands on the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning warning or patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, <unk> night of January.
I was sitting next to me in New York City in New York City and he started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and he worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what impressed me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a little kid in the field.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a little <unk> <unk> and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
It did it especially at the beginning of a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me, which was so so that I had been to Harvard, that I would put a passion in helping girls, and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why I was at that <unk> school and the job on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was going to go from New York and leave my job of my dreams, but I thought that I had to do sacrifices for your partner, and so I decided to quit my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head in a physical trap and financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where they were supposed to be, had to feel so sure it bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another guy caught under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns because of the trauma that lived in a small way.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never worked out my hand, my life was already serious <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and he still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, and I put my mother's suit and married him.
Despite what happened, I was so happy that we were living happily for always, because I loved her, and he also wanted me very much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had been very <unk> for the wedding and by the fact of forming a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I never would make any harm.
I spent twice in our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving down to a secret beach and I was <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I would spend a few times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back to our moon of honey, <unk> by traffic and threw myself a Big Mac <unk> on the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or harassing at some point in their life, and the Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I get <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a very strong man, in love with a very strong man -- and it was the only person in the world that could help <unk> to deal with the <unk>
The other question that everybody does is: Why don't you just get <unk>
Why don't I get <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do -- because we us, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of domestic violence occur after the victim has <unk> the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent bullying and even after the <unk> has become the permanent bullying of financial resources, and their children and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who was afraid to their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's not going to be <unk>
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved it, would have killed me if he allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the entire world: I told my neighbors, my neighbors, my friends and family, to my friends, to my friends, and I'm here today because all of you will get me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims of the victims as <unk> <unk> <unk>
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> <unk> for <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who have also heard a lot of stories of men and women who were joyful and happy lives and happily like <unk> wives and mothers, fully free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I became marrying a cute guy and <unk> and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever more, ever is a <unk> pistol pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
Right now, just as you think, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now that they're being <unk> or they were being <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Sound abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end with domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
We need the victims of the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They took the <unk> to the light talking about it with their children, their fellow work, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the mathematical signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the absolute oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel like at this point, there's a <unk> tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like this.  Thankfully, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they were <unk> they don't have to hear them now, but to find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what they think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> and less bad than I don't have to use it.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer said to me that I was going to get my back and get my hair <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or a artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> and we have also associated with a <unk> and <unk> shape to <unk> and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> to know both models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and each of the models in the <unk> and from the <unk> models -- just <unk> is to say, less than four percent, they weren't white people.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know about that.
But then what I would say to each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this spectacular list is still <unk> No, no, Cameron -- I want to be model, then I said, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of the <unk> of American magazine or the executive director of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like to say you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you've got your studies, and you have a couple of jobs on your backs, no matter what I think they want to be president of the United States, whether they want to be president of the United States of the United States, but you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yeah, virtually you get all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
This is how it was next to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in the <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people of <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: "Do you think about for free?
I have too many <unk> heel. I have never use, except for the previous couple -- but the privilege I get is the ones I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and forgot about bringing money, and they gave me the free dress free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> and he jumped a light light in red and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for being able to follow <unk>
<unk> of this privilege for my way, not by what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who were <unk> and <unk> 86 percent were black and Latino women, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young black people in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's about how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
When I research for this talk, I found out that to 53 percent of 13 girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number rises to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and I'm beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe they would do it.
<unk> It is really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people, ingenious creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I never said in front of the cameras, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with a smaller legs and the brightest hair will be more happy?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs, the brightest hair and the most <unk> but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there's something that will keep up from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was most enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures <unk> and I didn't know the <unk>
There was no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum <unk> in lighting.
In fact, most of them took tourists random.
My story starts when, and <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He gave it back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said, "Why don't you get to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that were going to give us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, nobody has never been <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would life change this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of concrete or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to think about our age and our evolution over the years, not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because even though we always get the same picture, our daughter gets to new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how it perceives and interacts with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the dolls store that <unk> small in previous visits ...
And he described to me what was five to the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are the memories.
So, I want to share the idea of engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and not <unk> in close to somebody and asked him, and you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney laughs as the characters <unk> stupid stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press -- laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> from the New World that are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the World Bank, where we have 16 species from these 16, 11, with a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> are important, first of all, they provide domestic ecological services, <unk>
It's our <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> the carcasses up to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax -- that wouldn't be because they were being built and caused great loss of livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the license and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between Times and below Egypt.
In the mythology -- <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open heaven -- in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being fossilized is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical review, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned from the veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there's no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge bomb bomb for <unk> The number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up top of the <unk> <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we need to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds.
It's <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and to the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that travel through different countries, so to focus on a developing problem is not going to serve anything.
We need to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciation at the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that we have.
How can you help? It can become active to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you would tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed by opinion because he saw it without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> a young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, <unk> <unk> and Somalia. In projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
And instead of that, everything that we did, the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people in Zambia to growing food.
So we got with seeds and <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the River <unk> and we teach local tomatoes and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, because of what they were going to do to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were reminded of the local people, in so fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we were possible to do anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here --  <unk> in time to save the people in Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these <unk> <unk> in Italy, a kind of evolved to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling them to <unk> "Look at how easy it is.
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> <unk> my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here,  "Why don't you say, "You're never going to kill you.
I thought we only did the Italians who were doing mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what the Americans, they were doing and then after seeing what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> will see the <unk>  <unk> seeing the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not telling you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
Our Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people only two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I'm trying to do any of a different culture as though my children, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as though I was my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "It little is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you will never lead anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does you? Are you <unk>
It will never come to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met at a coffee.  We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important one.
And then we helped them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for a time instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for a time -- but not in the hospital meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have they <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know the tell, because they're not attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business, which is set up with you at home, on the table of her kitchen, and helping him find the resources to transform her passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this condescending garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very, very hard.
I was going on, and --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've made it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped them start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most successful business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of death of the death of the <unk>
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to get to talk to you.
You have to offer you for privacy, it has to be great to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
What do you show you about this morning.
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneur entrepreneurship is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils <unk> fossils -- and from one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate by seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a journal magazine makes many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year, they got together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure was produced by six million horses and it would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up <unk> generic companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they will not come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute <unk> dedicated <unk>
And then then you will have to tell you to tell you about <unk>
The smallest company, the larger company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell is to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic <unk> and you have to have to have a fantastic financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, to sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 companies icons in the French world, <unk> Edison Ford, all new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one one, no one was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars and next to their secret comrades who are going to do you, what someone did for you, what someone did for this gentleman is talking about this <unk> someone who asked you, what need it?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." He looks like <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those people are around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't reverse a lot of knowledge despite the case of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes to the cows store so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It will always go to the music.  There is a parade in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the most beautiful amount of U.S. abandoned properties.
I live close to this house and thought how it could turn it into a <unk> space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected age.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this made me a deep gratitude for the living time and the time of time.
He gave the most significant things of my life today.
But I would try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch over the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the support of old and new friends became the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die, I want to be <unk> by <unk>  "Before we die I want to stay in the line of <unk>
Before I die I would die for millions of people."
Before we die, I want to plant a <unk>
Before we die, I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before we die I want to die once more."
Before I die, I want to go to the rescue rescue.
"Before we die I want to be completely <unk>
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> <unk> and gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving up the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we are growing and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center we made a kit, and now they've been done walls in countries around the world, as <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions that are increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is a short and delicate life.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that we get more power.
If you think about the death of our life.
Our shared spaces, can reflect better than individuals and as a community and more means to share the fears and the more of stories, people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's very <unk>
I don't talk about, but it makes joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> is going to happen what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this -- never <unk>
When I sing the songs of our childhood, trying to say a word that I could not even be able to <unk> the little thing that we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year where every songs of my iPod, conversation that we kept when I was four years old, you pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't adjust to the concept of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they wouldn't consider it inside of it, it could only mean one thing -- that they were autistic and autistic people.
Now, for those of the less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In every single individual it manifests itself in a different way, so that it's so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developing disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or no cure cure for it.
I don't remember my first meeting with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
It was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new thing to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking out the washing washing machine, and eat whatever I had to be in between <unk>
As I grew up, it would come back more different, and the differences were getting more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature -- a kid who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change by normality.
<unk> goes through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could afford a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would not have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal, is the ultimate <unk> of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change die at the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the middle of the <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a teacher of communications, which would give a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was afraid.  <unk> <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and their big <unk> words.
But when I developed those conversations, I felt like I had a sense when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
Just like I felt that when I had those conversations with students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a lot of communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to environment and health care and health care -- and if we don't know how to understand this, the work is not in fact, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their whole world.
So scientists and engineers, please take care of <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
They don't tell us that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care about <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as making them stupid <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, said it's just as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate with clearly your science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and stories, and these are ways of hooking and <unk> with their content.
And when you introduce your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been wondering why they call <unk>  What do they do the <unk> kill them, kill their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it supports too much in the language of the language of our brain and <unk> us.
In contrast, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple quote -- <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then we will provide graphs that will lead our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they were <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words across the Oxford English Times is <unk>
Just because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who looks for a public charge without matter -- platform or beginning, and when wins, gets it through the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means to <unk>
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words they said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> named <unk> <unk> who was faced with the <unk>
They threw in the Tower of London, and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to get back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that could be <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> from the American People in the U.S.
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And there might be <unk>
Everyone got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
<unk> House didn't want the Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call him King for if he was giving him or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give you the most <unk> more <unk> more <unk> and the most unfortunate title that you were happening.
And that title was <unk>
The President. They didn't invent the title. There was only before, but it only meant <unk> which was a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> title.
And that's why the Senate was <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to take a serious title with a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate don't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate in the action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says a measure is <unk>  <unk> we will keep waiting for <unk> more years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, and I want to tell you, is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy of the world and a fleet of <unk> vehicles and so on.
The reality and history has endowed with the title of <unk>
So by the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness in the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has five nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the House of Representatives won because no one is going to be humble when you tell you that you're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do to you with.
Politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but actually change a lot more the words than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet under the land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is warm and dust and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but most of all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and stones with primitive.
Like the others, I carry a flashlight of light -- he supports the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that subway hole that falls hundreds of feet on the ground.
And my hand was <unk> and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days earlier, who lost the control and he fell down <unk> in that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the depths of that hole at risking their lives without paying no reward and often, dying.
And I went out of that hole and I went home, but they may never be, because they're prey of slavery.
Over the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the developing Peace <unk>
Between all the amazing people that I met there was <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who's involved in eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not just like grade.
When we finished talking about I was very <unk> I was honestly to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> your stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these sites.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people who are in the world.
It's twice as much of the number of African Africans during all of the slave slaves to do.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a couple of <unk> today.
However, today you can enslaving entire families for generations for <unk> <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over 13,000 dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to figure out that they are forced to work without pays under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> the world's goods produced by slaves have value, but the people who produce them are disposable cups.
<unk> exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal to be illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick <unk>
This strange show, <unk> show was like getting into the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> on a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- in a heavy, mechanically mechanically ventilated families, in their heads, and they take them from the <unk> furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no breath to eat -- not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it just a lot of <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to each other, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the equipment and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the middle of <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> I didn't do it. Don't do you here."
And it explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I wasn't the citizenship of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for her release and trusted that he <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children carrying stones for miles per <unk> <unk> to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who put them and the children would merge their heads with <unk> <unk> made from <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something that <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers fail, their freedom, the <unk> had lost their houses.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was passionate about women who had been previously <unk> sex.
It led to me on the stairs <unk> that gave this basement <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more like a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local for prostitution by <unk>
They have small rooms. They have small rooms where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- they're forced to <unk> customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each put is dark and <unk> identified by a painted number on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their own customers.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I barely could imagine what it must be stuck on that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs and the stairs just had a <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no big windows as to <unk>
Those people have no <unk> and, because they touch a very difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service and the list can continue.
So recently, New York Times reported that between 100,000 people and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves are sold every year.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often associate with the labor of <unk>
I went to I went to Indian villages where there were entire families -- in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
The black hands of black are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still wait, though, that we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the <unk> <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two older children, some young children -- a few young children -- makes sense right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, even though they don't know swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
<unk> branches submerged in Lake <unk> and they often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear of the water to release the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
By fear of his love is not going to run and, as a whole life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is about the younger slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when we did the last networks, but they had been working on the whole one of the time.
On the cold night and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which we <unk> the <unk> <unk> to victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their hats suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to take it on a road to the forest.
At the end of the way, we were getting rid of the car, and he asked the driver to come up very quickly.
Then you signal this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that I would get on the path and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I put it into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs and, while they were looking at gold, <unk> in water <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These mining are <unk> in a very well on another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pit they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet and these people carry heavy plastic bags that then will be shipped to another area where they would break the stone to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, it seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer at the side of the side, we see to work at other less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> end up as this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died she took him to work with him in mines.
By dying their uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle that will force the force to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, I was working on the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet to that, it's forced to work and day on that mine.
And yet, he dream with being released and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in a remote, that inspires me a lot to respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to get witness to them and we'll make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves with each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I would happen that I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to know.
And I hope that these images wake up a force where you see them in people like you, and I hope that strength will turn on a fire and that fire light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make mathematical math, and there is a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like the management consultants <unk>
Nobody knows what the heck we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see more ahead.
But language demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably some <unk> <unk> that can well have a genetic component,
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's -- gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at their time was a virtuous dance dance.
Over the last few years it's been done very much in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we will know if there is actually a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of the movement there are no biological <unk> so they don't have the blood analysis, and the best we have is a neurological <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that it was from the clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> journey to the clinic. What if patients could be done by the test they ourselves?
They would not need any personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do to you -- as a really conventional form for a try, you can see in some sense at least -- we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds at the way -- we can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sound and we all have the genes needed to do it for example.
And as the sick, requires a level of extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as they <unk> and as Parkinson's disease affects <unk> also affects <unk> organs.
On the bottom-up plot you can see an endless shake of <unk> strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
<unk> <unk> isn't <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
These are both accurate <unk> OK, but they also have <unk> tests on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They are <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
And when something takes a cost so <unk> it appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce the patient's <unk>
I don't need to go to the clinic for <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get data goals.
We could make it massive at low cost for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a big scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving you today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to address these goals.
We have affordable lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without Parkinson's, can be called low price and leave recordings for about cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: And so <unk> taking all these samples of, say 10,000 people -- you can say, who are healthy and who doesn't you?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call call to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> They may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in pursuit of the actual markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have an precision <unk> at this point?
<unk> Much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to do a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works in the mobile phone network, as well as we put the project. We now have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were focusing on the darkness, in rooms with no windows and generally we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin is still more perfect -- we do the perfect skin -- we can do it in the press all the time, but some of us are actually artists with a talent with many years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was the <unk> in the place working as a part of the answer.
So with hundreds of other volunteers we learned that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave, the <unk>
The <unk> water level reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers in the ground.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and leave the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons of black fish -- <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and pictures of photos and cameras and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of people around around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a center of the people.
It helped clean the toilets, big, huge <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the <unk> center was the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going down my horizons that something happened.
In looking at the photos, I found some that they had more than a hundred years old, some of them were still in the lab in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went on Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too much <unk> but where the water was <unk> the face of the girl had <unk> with a lot of accuracy and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as he had the photo <unk>
Over the time the time, they came to luck more photos, and it took more <unk> so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries was offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once at the week we use our scanner in the middle criminal libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their pictures.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could be a couple of weeks.
It could be months.
This <unk> had to draw virtually by hand using a guide to the areas whose color and detail the water was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures long, <unk> covered in bacteria, even with algae -- even with oil over time, I continue to <unk> that was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean dry and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky enough with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos already <unk>
As once he said, <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman that brought us these pictures were lucky enough to the photos.
I had started <unk> her same but she stopped realizing that it was even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face would not have been able to reconstruct the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When they picked up their photos shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the pictures in a fire station, between the rubble of far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would take it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Her children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took a week to find her family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his pictures his little son he was 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could remember from the past that would not have been marked on the past day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined in there, <unk> hundreds of them helped us to clean up with more than <unk> photographs -- the great majority of them, the great majority came to their hands of their own <unk>
Over 500 volunteers from everyone around the world helped us to return to 90 families hundreds of photos completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more than a thousand <unk> and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We take pictures.
One picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, someone loved it.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take on, but the first thing to look for.
So about this was the project to restore little pieces of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture looks like this give someone a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something larger, to bring something, using your talent for something that are not very physical models of perfect skin.
And I would like to finish this email. I sent him Cindy the day I went from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't help but think about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular in particular, a photo with women in different ages from the grandmother to the girl, gathered around a baby, <unk> around a baby, <unk> because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my newborn daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion -- but a trillion frames per second.
Let me introduce you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create a slow camera of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see behind the <unk> beyond the baseline or to see the inside of the body without using X-ray and <unk> and defy the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on and put it into a second of a second or whatever, in a number of <unk> to create a package of photons just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet is a common <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons spread inside this <unk>
What is what the light looks like in <unk>
Now, all this --   Remember that all of this is effectively in less than a <unk> is what it takes to <unk>
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to do this research --   <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it's going to the table, and we started looking at these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that some of the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> bullet and we make it go the same distance and see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much they think they would take us to see that film?
One day? It's a week?
It would be a very boring movie --  -- very slow in motion.
And what about <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves that go from the table, the <unk> and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a photo, I thought, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at a more and more <unk> you realize that, as the light gets rid of your tomato <unk> it's still brilliant.
Why? Because the tomato <unk> is <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in their mobile phones, they will be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So why do we create this camera in India?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture to low exposure, you go very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the <unk> just just get into something of light.
So we sent that <unk> that photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and again with a very <unk> <unk> and we took those <unk> data and <unk> them to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all those data in raw and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. <unk> you go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
So we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good time resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point corresponds to how distance.
When you project a laser can record a picture of <unk> which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> with what is going on the curve, <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at the light reflected by the open windows of the world.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new presence of visualization to solve the problems of conversation in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, it became the science in art, an art of photographs of photographs itself.
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
So creating a new form of computer photography with color <unk>
And look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves waves is just a few <unk> from a second.
But here's a lot of fun here.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going off of us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
So it turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order of the events occur in the world in the world sometimes comes into the camera.
You know, the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can make your life, and it gives you free freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> the humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, you get it to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of thousands of people are going to have a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were going to go to search for a change, had a cell phone in our pocket.
Who are the <unk> who have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile phone, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Data weapons.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission I presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider has to store a wide range of information from the users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, on their phone company or your Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe people went and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some people even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Europe.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> that at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information they had about me.
And I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to <unk> a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we're not giving this information.
At the end of the end, I <unk> right.
They would give me the demand and they would send me the information I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about the <unk> in a <unk>
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> as a lot of information.
When I first saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized this is my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open came on, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can get closer and close, go back and go forward.
You can see every step I give it.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and what often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives you a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there's things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then you call the other one, and then we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate each other to what time they call each other to what hour to sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who email an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, had a cell phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who was the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible inside the web.
They want to have the chance to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and that it's not quite a fashion.
When you go home, you will take your representative to your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that I would take to remember that you have to fight for <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have brain palsy, that's why <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm kind of a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, even though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any one of them in this room.
You feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you've had a disabled person.
Let's go for a walk.
<unk> in Christmas, they are at the commercial center, drive in circles to look for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
And I say, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim <unk> woman, <unk> and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk> <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three major sisters <unk> me <unk>
If my three older sisters went to the public school, my parents were going to the school system and <unk> that I was also outside, and if we didn't take all the top note -- all of them took my mother.
My father taught me how to walk the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang out a dollar in front of me so that I was doing it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion that has received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are now 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the policymakers would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign campaign.
The people that I grew up there was no trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of dying of hunger during the <unk>
And I told them that there was enough fat to live three months without eating -- so the dawn of dawn to sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, on <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I was spending my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were going on to <unk>
In summer vacation, I often tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I was drinking milk on the back, and I was sitting on the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the cure cure was yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a <unk> comedy that I couldn't stand up with a <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents had this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of the State of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
They all got me wrong.
I did all the tasks of the least smart <unk> I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo of glass my <unk>
But I never got a paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work from a girl with brain <unk>
I was a girl with brain <unk>
So I started to shout at the four <unk> at the end of a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of <unk> At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> at the end of the end, I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask me why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the kinds of risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts stunts can't do the <unk>
It was a role that literally was born and gave it to an actress without the brain <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled paper.
When I graduated from I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was as extra as a <unk>
My dream was true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> of <unk> do not <unk> but not white, with disability.
They just pay for perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
On my first tour, I took famous books from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedy that led when he fell into the realization that I was going to high speed on the highway in New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the entire United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, but not <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they find it very funny.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media, and I once remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of stigma in disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the news program on cable <unk> with Keith <unk>
I went on as if I was to a graduate dance, I was reminded of a study and sat down to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, three <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling on to the desk desk to go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
And I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I was like a full-time participant and I closed my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are <unk> but they never get away from me no girl and no older girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I would have online clips on the line with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite <unk>
What does it have?
We really should pray for this."
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't do <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with the media, but I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create most positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that <unk> less hate the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> the red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world -- <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> a charity to give children refugee kids, a little bit of what my parents would love me.
It was the only time my father saw me live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know your name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
The drought drives the small people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without it there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there's no opportunity, no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside <unk>
After maybe one year ago, you get anything.
One day you read about a gentleman who offered him to <unk> after dinner, after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a <unk> group of people, which gives it a break.
She gets a little bit of money for her to buy new clothes, money to send your family.
They show you a young boy.
Finally, you home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb car.
That little boy of that little town with dreams of the great city was the <unk> bomber and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a young town of a young town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that we took out of what we call "the <unk> <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking at something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the one of the opportunity, of work, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
Often it's youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities -- the story of <unk> to <unk> the door to terror, to violence, to <unk> to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I'd seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to house a juvenile leaders at a business degree.
<unk> to 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because I was a college student, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white man for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point A to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
She started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point expanding to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think that their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so quickly.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who was attended to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of business and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business enterprise.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers to your <unk> <unk> we were sent from plastic from <unk>
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, "You could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And he began the delivery of flowers for wedding by creating gardens in the houses, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink pink <unk>
And by the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged encouraged to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and creating a culture of corporate spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and guidance to <unk> in development and put it out of their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from understanding the creation, and they will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the corporate spirit is something more than start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park <unk> that's how it's called, when it's created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired children from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
It gave them the opportunity to escape from paralysis of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> in the middle of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> as a <unk> and not to be on the way that we were going to do -- we almost could pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> shed with a beautiful <unk> <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with <unk> hearts and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he was <unk> he was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they had to do, who thought he was going to clean their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where <unk> the <unk> who cleans our garbage in <unk>
Who cleans our garbage in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
So here in New York City, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, for 11 tons of waste -- and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know to know how individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through their routes and interviewed people in offices and I interviewed people in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I started working as <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you can get away very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the world's most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You are coming out and entering the traffic all day and you go through it.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
He never leaves coming.
It's also like a <unk> way or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think the <unk> <unk> are the most important work of the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste and efficient and effective every day, this starts to take away from their containers and their dangers inherent in a very real way.
We have controlled for decades and centuries and start to come up with <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old -- we don't have space for what the drivers of the economy are starting to fail when it's in danger consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointing its relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed speed necessary.
With that, I mean, just at the speed as we used to move in the <unk> age.
We usually don't get rid of it, and we don't get it off, and we carry our coffee cup -- our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that would take away from it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the waste collection that maybe you will help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us ceases to benefit from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of <unk> on the street, grabbed my little son and went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled recycled as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started looking at the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together a lot of times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
The city waste -- what we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic for it.
So in the flow of your days and your lives, the next one you see someone whose <unk> is clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our community life to make part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
So today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because the coating with <unk> it generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, what does it look like to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a worthwhile for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually born with the old market that is this structure to the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using the public space to make external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial mall.
But the question was how to build a modern modern building, from several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced to the location of the site, which is located in a lot of growth growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist yet.
And it's also among two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the entries in the building.
And this goes with an inverted <unk> that creates an outdoor air in the building that goes through its own shape and rain.
And around this space we've applied the market idea with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that would address the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric to a concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons of the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and it helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
So with these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what they <unk>
But at all, we all realized that this market idea was much more profitable than the commercial center was much more profitable than the commercial center of the mall had more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was a lot more economic, not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy to the building in a city where electricity is almost every day.
So we got a big advantage putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the ceiling, that we collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, since we go through the fifth floor of the building.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the biggest thing that I was designed, I needed not just understanding the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, their tradition and culture.
So during that analysis, I put attention on the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a <unk> wall that was surrounded by a dozen <unk> doors on almost straight.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets in existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar to the size and the features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some strategic points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this triggered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell cell project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So let's make a scheme to make sure that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set up a greater density at higher levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community of the space <unk> by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can climb up and <unk> and do activities such as running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common focus on the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had a lot of very bright hair and a little <unk> <unk> and it was very strong <unk> for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I finished that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed in a time after the age of school, I was a little late afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom <unk>
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked in the classroom, I went on the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher <unk>
And then I did.
<unk> the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few like this.
All like that.  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and I just got a row out of that, just because of being there, because they were <unk>
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never get <unk>
It was that everything was obvious <unk>
I will never get <unk>
But most of all, I would tell you the reason why I was bothered by this little girl so small, so small to <unk>
They <unk> jealousy.
They are so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And also, the primates. <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of jobs in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that will be <unk> or the long duration or sadness.
And so you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab where you see the <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no jealousy, <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
It wouldn't have Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school school, because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without anticipation there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of how much they have all of them.
This year is spent 100 years of his work -- "In search of the time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also from ordinary <unk> -- my God, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how recommended it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as a cat.
I don't know how the cat, the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they are so good together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, ability to reduce the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a very good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel anticipation we tell ourselves a story.
One story about people's lives of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being at the same time, storytellers and audience, we know exactly what to <unk> to <unk> the <unk> right?
<unk> do us all of these <unk> <unk> and that is something that I could understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give other people, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single charm that <unk> detects in his lover adds up to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out of it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like the big amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> <unk> <unk> language <unk> with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony suddenly listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then it angered those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> you see <unk> and they make it seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for truth, a really painful truth -- in fact, what they were going to do, the more painful -- the better the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to do -- that makes us suffer, it causes us to make a much more profound range of feelings much more profound and vital than a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. And I think it's trying to say that <unk> would reveal us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very young woman who was being consumed with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud says there was something weird about that man, who didn't get <unk> in what his wife's wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that did his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behavior.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud says the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
The novels describe very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the harder we are, the more we are, we are we more than we become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> us to do violent or illegal <unk>
<unk> are helping us behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself in the age of 8 years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from the one that would send a little bit awful message to itself, for a year.
For one year, it all year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How big even though we do creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that treat our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> their most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to be aware of your being and <unk> from what you've ever seen, and it's under the floor. <unk> your name, takes your bank bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, as well as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in terms of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show you <unk> I'm not secure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they are to a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had a <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius <unk>
Oh, I sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of Six <unk> once that <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who would not like to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I find this very emotional -- that scene also is mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're on the same side.
All of a sudden <unk> you can admire that idea of being <unk>
Could it be that easy?
What if <unk> are actually a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember we have the fiction for <unk>
Just fiction <unk> jealousy.
Science used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> the terrifying <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On the 21st of July in 1969, Buzz Aldrin was jumped out of the <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Beaufort Sea.
Armstrong and flags, they were alone, but their presence in the gray surface of the surface was the culmination of a collective process of <unk>
The Apollo program was the biggest job of peace in American history.
To get to the moon -- NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
<unk> gave up about 400,000 people and asked the 20,000 <unk> collaboration and government agencies and government agencies.
They died people, including the Apollo crew crew one.
But before the Apollo program was <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on her surface, which was after the death of Armstrong last year, is the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask, why is it <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why can you scale the most <unk>
So 35 years ago, why do you fly over the <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> of <unk> it wasn't just a victory of the West about the West -- in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the significance of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> <unk> and eliminated smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship, or a ship, but in 1969, the Apollo crew flew to 40,000 miles / hour.
Since 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled to the power of Apollo 10, and the very optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems we imagine that technology would solve as going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world's population seem to be <unk>
I remember looking at the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube from the Cold Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission, but I was completely sure I could get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that thing happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems as if the technologists would have <unk> us and they were enriched with trivial toys -- things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> for the years that they would be asked to, Intel is <unk>
Silicon Valley says markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that are the venture capitalists provide entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk of risk caused by the creation of ideas that are <unk> by the funding of problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mainly in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists of venture capitalists were at the highest point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investments, the ones that could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit in technologies like energy, that they need a huge capital and the development of the development that have never invested in the development of technology intended to solve great problems because they don't have a proper commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want to have alternative energy sources that can compete at the price -- don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are actually according to what policies and international treaties will develop a significant increase in the research and development development, and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate of today's political policy that we're going to see a foreign energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that looked like technology, turns not to be.
We know for a long time that famines are a result of failure to <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affects <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage to the storage and deal of food, but there will be famines while there was bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found highly effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have to have -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to be able to fix the problem: the institutions must support the <unk> must be really a problem with <unk> and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, it runs with those risks.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no competition -- like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction as the idea of exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows we're not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the <unk> ideas that you have about trust.
They are so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decline of trust, is a very general belief for it.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First of all, what people think is that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to thinking that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions, and that could be increased in others.
I have no clear.
But I can turn to opinion polls and <unk> polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls you have no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and political -- keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still a lot of <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half a way.
But is this enough?
What of opinion polls are of course, views.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is <unk> attitudes that people care when they make certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at the <unk> teachers.
They probably ask for the question: "To do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official, and the officer or a person -- it's going to be uniform in all of those.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my youngest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives, in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they're trying to give you a good trial by the fact that you trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think this is stupid.
It's not that the goal that I would have.
I want to get more confidence in what it is about trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who had their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart objective in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it is about to make a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a judgment, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw subjects and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason for trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we cannot trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that it would take their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If this is that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're looking at right now before we trust.
trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials, and so that they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once he was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to do the killer <unk> that I will attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we would argue that the system of accountability is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we would call the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
<unk> all of that, for the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you were going to be worthy of being worthy of trust and give them to people that are safe and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, the simple action, the <unk> which is not done properly.
Third, the task.
So let's move at the task to rebuild the confidence, you put things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve the trust.
But trust, ultimately, is a signature because they give us great people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give you the foundations enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to have <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is every day everywhere, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says that I can <unk> without giving explanations.
I take them and get it back money, or they change them by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get you vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in the relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of glass of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers your physical body to pixels.
And designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool break the barriers.
But two hands remain outside of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill of your hands?
In the division of Science <unk> of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little bit of the keyboard on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
<unk> a transparent display with the depth of depth to detect your fingers and face, now you can get the hands of the keyboard, get into the inner space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point out of lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that there's the bottom of every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are going on in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
We had a lot of us shall have bought and sort of done things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, and I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make it physics so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would the future be like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical hole.
This magnet, <unk> behaves like a pixel in 3D in space, which means that the computer as the users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and forth and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or the textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital data is not just going to show you something but will start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to get rid of our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if you get that barrier, the only limit that stays our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk> years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes and <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, create firmly that there was only a accurate path to the <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether I would like it or not.
But my dream was to be an Chinese opera artist.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would tell the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life is a second kind of happiness.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look at another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
Let's go to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that was here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not a <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to myself, "It is so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> guilt trap. And to reset the relationship with my parents.
And I find it with a new culture that was also place to my habit of reading <unk>
A lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me out of place, because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like religion comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if <unk> reading worked for research, why not do it in the life of <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and political and spiritual policies.
For Buddha, are all <unk> bad fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be able to feel like I used to be able to feel like that.
Having a <unk> dream really is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
The most important purpose is to connect with the place that comes the dreams, of where the passion is coming from, where happiness comes from.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So, the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client in <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical Berkeley.
She was a 40 year-old woman called <unk>
Alex came into the first session with jeans and a <unk> came down on the couch of my office and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex brought the <unk> became easy only to move the head while they were going to make the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work later, they got home, they got children later, to death later.
In order as Alex and I had a time to eat it.
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex who talked about her life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like being married with him."
And then my <unk> said, "It's still not, but maybe it's going to be <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex percent of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment <unk>
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of recklessness <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and their loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of all over the place.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they consider that nobody gets to age without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be going to be 35 years.
This means that eight of 10 decisions and experiences and moments and moments that give your life to your life will have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> people are not trained to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that they would have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change itself, now it's the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to its top at 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to take care of their body and their options.
When we think about developing a child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which his everyday life and common life has a <unk> impact on the person who gets <unk>
But what we don't hear today is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
Researchers are called <unk> a extended <unk>
<unk> journalists <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> what is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
So Leonard <unk> said that to get big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> intelligent, interesting as you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, it's not good for me, but this relationship doesn't notice. I'm just killing the time."
Or they say, "All the way I start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes on the <unk> were like the game game.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around 30, it turned to music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be a stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but it doesn't get <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's an enormous pressure on the top and so many of you start a career, to choose a city, pick a partner, and have two or three children in a much more time period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's research that start to show you, which is a lot more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle <unk> crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
"You know, you can't have the son you want to have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and you talk about their <unk> "What was I doing?"
I want to change what the ones are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma got to my office because he was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but I couldn't still decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often <unk> in our <unk> but then they would raise her to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for nearly the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book book for <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he got looking at the empty space that follows after the words in <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if he gives me <unk>
At that moment, it took me a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
She needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as a little bit of sit as a little bit of sit as the 1930s.
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> men or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that was going to get rid of that crisis of identity and <unk> identity capital.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this:
So now it's the moment for the other side of the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> climate exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make it count.
Secondly, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the ones that get together with friends with similar minds just as much as you know who you know, what you know about, how do you talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes from the outside circle of the <unk>
The new things come from what's called the weak ties of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> they have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half no, and the weak ties are the way to <unk> this group.
Half of the <unk> jobs never <unk> then to meet the head of your neighbor is the way to get a really published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma would soon join her family, when he has a partner and form his own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit in my head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or you're going to tell you now when everyone on Facebook start to walk to <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that implies to be so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it or kill time with anyone who will be <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped me get a job there.
That job offer he gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who alive.
Now, five years later, it's particularly special <unk> events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the actual emergency rooms are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like airplanes that come out from the airport from Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea of spreading all the ones that have heard of.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma all day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get <unk> and using identity capital, picking up your family.
They don't know what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very expensive job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics <unk> in New York City in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When I work back, <unk> grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. is not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no I.Q. I.Q. tests.
Some of my smartest children were not doing so well.
And that made me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what if we have success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick and that easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied early <unk> working in really difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of learning their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, wondering what of these vendors are going to maintain their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, there was a feature as a very important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health and it wasn't I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is having resistance.
<unk> is embracing his future, day after day, not just for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my determination of determination and then I waited about more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when they <unk> them in every single feature that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of the evidence <unk> even security they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing we know, the little thing that we know about the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you build your determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids an ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are simply not going ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, human determination is not related or even related to the usual measurements.
Until now, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how they change and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was interested in this incredible language.
But for overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall Street China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can take this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language that can do it.
I started thinking about how a new way and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy people.
The first 200 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read <unk> menus from <unk> to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it could be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was screaming <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the shape of the flame -- but I like to believe it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> at these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are <unk>
If a person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> just like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two glimpse together, it becomes very hot.
Three glimpse together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three people together, have care is <unk>
So we've already gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters to build other 32.
So with every small effort, you're going to be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the earth in the sun.
This is a sun in the <unk> because Japan is east of China.
So one sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> to their enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where you go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking about and go down from the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie was a little imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic wand show.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raising our children in a kind of a <unk> industrial <unk>
However, the acoustic magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> boy would get a girl dressed as a <unk> of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling prophecy.
They were <unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies made by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing of the acoustic magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made Star Wars my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
It's only three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the destruction of surveillance had been <unk>  So she was so slid in the room and she was impressed as a foot of my leg with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what he was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It should be the feeling that Luke is one military to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician of <unk>
How does Dorothy his movie?
<unk> <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to grow up, and not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there as much <unk> capital force in the movies for our children, and as little as the way of building bricks <unk>
There are a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know for experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who have been <unk>  I think at the time of the first sure it really was expected to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search for me has finished, I have a <unk>
Why keep standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be an <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they, guys, aren't really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job when they teach girls how to defend them against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of every time is still coming up in classic after classic each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a child.
Until as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the critical criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens by the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It still hasn't been left and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation I'd had with a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there's more of a female character who has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the kid you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good <unk> movie.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what's a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen by the test of <unk>
And I don't think I think it would be, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have lots of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 <unk> films, how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he would say.
One in the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I think the music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics -- one of the things that I think is that there's a huge amount of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they not get to <unk>
They're <unk> the story that he says is that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness to <unk> <unk> and we hope that we would have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and I mean mostly parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of manhood is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter which was his favorite Star Trek character -- you know what you do?"
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress in it.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them get their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I would tell my <unk> <unk> and fight only and more stories where their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things that I knew most of was to look for the sea of Maine at the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're filled with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was going to tell you to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and the <unk>
And finally, when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1,300 miles away from length along with <unk>
And my seawater had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in simple view, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using false color, suddenly the place looks like a bright pink place.
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of landscape caused by the building materials and the activities of the old Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old city, old <unk> called a lost <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of the ancient arts and architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> per mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, he moved to this and covered all the city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
I'll try to find him at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with <unk> eyes, and using baseball.
So we use NASA data from NASA to make a place map, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, we think it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take it on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, underneath a thick <unk> of background, we found a dense layer of objects of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> <unk> layer of a number of years that date out of the Middle East, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what shows that there was a workshop workshop there.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Ottoman Empire. These are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense <unk> <unk> which goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry shop showing that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find <unk> here, but they would take place to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to TED it was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas happen in 1984 <unk> C. in a lost town not for a long time and found from the high time.
It certainly puts the <unk> <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's done.
Now you have a group of <unk> obese in bicycles.
They are competing in a race cooking race and they go back to their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're going <unk>
They collide with the door of their home.
There is bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that go on the side of the wheels that end up in <unk> places, <unk> the threshold of the door.
<unk> into the hall, or what there is to the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, about a brown horse.
It's a horse that speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> by making it a little bit of the blue <unk> on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you're about to go into the mouth.
They go on one side and they trained their living room.
In the room, and making most of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on his center center, singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now I get to the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a yellow brick path, and from the oven, come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of the United States."
I was to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ladies and different behavior.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- just look at them once.
We had the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
They took whole poems in just just minutes.
<unk> to see who I could memorize as quickly the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This one is a man called Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best memories <unk>
I said, "Well, when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everyone involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
We have trained us to perform these miracle acts of memory using some old <unk> techniques invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their speeches and that <unk> academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the classroom of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant English, although a little bit <unk> said, <unk> you are an American artist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards in a deck of national television.
That would show you the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why don't sometimes work and what the potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> is amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed our memory to see how our memory does that we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went on a evening together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on return, I read a number of treaties on memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in the <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having disciplined and disciplined memory and <unk> was not one thing as rare as it can seem like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we also have changed.
They have changed to us, and I would say that they have changed as well.
As we are almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory and <unk> is this unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team of researchers from University University invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to be brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting difference that was really interesting and significant between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control that the <unk>
When they put them in a <unk> MRI machine, you know, your brains as they were <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They were actually <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driving as a armed race where each year, someone has a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must have a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards -- <unk> who he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was just <unk>
He used a very similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques by the end of the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> says this: I say two people who remember the same word -- I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
So what do you do?
The person who told him is that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually does not mean for you. There's no relationship to you.
All the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use white hats.
They have <unk>
They do well when they come home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when we did that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back 2,500 years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story is like this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up in foot, <unk> his poem of memory, and he was <unk> and it was so soon it was, the classroom of the <unk> was <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But it didn't only kill everyone, but it shattered the bodies to <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they could not be able to afford the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing out there, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every single day.
I took the family of the hand of hand to where their loved ones were in between the rubble.
What <unk> picked up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it doesn't matter whether we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and <unk>
And if you ask them to tell you, the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to get it very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to tell you who I was sitting on the horse as brown as the brown appearance in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it from memory, the same way that would have done it -- if they were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that you're on the door of your house.
And I come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and you can see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that they want to count.
And then they run into the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk about would be that strange journey that did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
So this is how <unk> <unk> <unk> their speeches -- not a word for word, which is going to confuse me?
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek -- which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his courthouse.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got out of full of it.
I went to some of these memory <unk> and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
And seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone will fall off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put me in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school woman bought a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it is actually about doing is to make it better, more and more the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and a pair of security sticks with tape only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a competitor <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered in a year before. I had the idea that I could be able to call it in a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just so little tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build your memory <unk> or you have to benefit from <unk> to benefit from a little bit about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
Great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them is not <unk> by there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what I want to leave you with today, is what I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our short existence <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks into our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even get <unk> in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory abilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It is a complex issue, so it <unk> only a <unk> place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my child's <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time looking at the television television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, and everyone looked at me, and I went back in a towel -- I all looked at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> and I hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, not about math -- and of those connections that are emotional and emotional connections, that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you're going to do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what they think about it is based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we built our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time for a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments, and governments are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this kind of round thing, columns -- red brick -- that they leave <unk> what is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, human values history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of equipment for the city, a place to meet and read and sharing.
So what is possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new new technologies, new solutions for today's life forms.
We were able to do it and we did it so much, that we get out of the people.
And all of black, this is going to get us -- you think we feel very well, but we're dead in because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and come back to the other side of those symbols that we are.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we are all happy, but we really feel like <unk> So we started experimenting with <unk> we can swing the cross-section back to the next 300 years, and we have done it in the last 300 years, of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago it was about the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk> scale.
Something really really hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know that we like and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add a <unk> and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we create memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the early 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> we now have new design techniques, and we have new design techniques in the computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are going on against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something else happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> and public and general public were in general, were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times newspaper is <unk> this construction <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So, all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> L.A., Seattle, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms, and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened -- because the media will spread around them and quickly learned that those forms of culture and tourism.
We've created a emotional reaction with these shapes.
They made the main mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the new third country is with other star.
And I went to <unk> and what happened to <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the back of the new millennium, actually started going through all of architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, they can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
<unk> is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so quickly.
It's not a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I knew when I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found them with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement for 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen. Because we're on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, and it starts to be in both extremes -- almost in <unk> and effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, in fact, the architects, and the architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> <unk> in the state of New York.
It's a holiday community.
But that meant two years before the building, the building was already part of the community, and it was a part of the community, and it looked at exactly the product -- there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media environment, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and when these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can take the mayor of <unk> to people from <unk> and tell them that there are no unique response to what a library can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using words -- <unk> and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public that doesn't accept something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of a style to each other, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find proper solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical brick in the basis of ideas that must be <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that buildings will be transferred to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also can serve to do sports or to <unk> or even you can get married at night.
This means that three architects can dream in swimming in the East <unk> of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no longer matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you like this.
And finally, we're not on <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
Buildings are not only reflecting our society, but they shape the most prestigious spaces, local libraries the homes where we formed our children, and the step of the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
He just turned a year and she started walking.
And it does it in that cool way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you do like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And it made me think, when's a couple of doing this?
How is it that we suddenly are comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people look at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as a teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, despite his mom telling him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells you and what his friends, or fellow colleagues said, you don't know who to believe.
So a video of her itself, publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal <unk> and <unk> and getting these answers into one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate in this way.
But what's going on to do this?
Well, the teenagers of today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother said, "It is like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, we're always connected to be connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what it's rigged itself.
What is the biggest thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a day?
And where are they looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are <unk> from the girls of the girls.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who call it, <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to look at what young people are <unk>
But the kids aren't immune to this.
Like the ones of the superheroes of sport, and the <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we surely want our children to grow healthy and be dead individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of its physical capabilities -- their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as we have to challenge society and the field of working development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class. <unk> participate in the classroom because they don't want to call attention to their physical <unk>
One of five are not attending class at all of the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you see good enough, specifically if you don't think you're sufficiently thin, <unk> a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't care about what it looks like.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
It gives up regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, for sure, we are talking about how you see you, not how you see you.
The low self-esteem of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem they do less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy that you can take them to a food mess with them.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at higher risk of depression.
And we think that's because of all of this because of what they make more effective decisions like the consumption of alcohol and of drugs, diet <unk> aesthetics, sexual relationships at early ages and no protection and no harm.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether they have or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
<unk> percent of women are not present to an interview interview in a day where they don't feel safe in the way you see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking, for itself, doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So, we must make sure that the program that our children continue to do is not just a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be crucial of any willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
A education is fundamental -- but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue, and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
By challenging the current status of how women are viewed and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell with the contribution of our politicians to <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judging the people for what they are, not because of what they can see.
We can all start by doing that by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can afford people in their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, "When was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and for businesses, to truly change our culture, so our children will grow up to be valuing all of their person, valuing the individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's do a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be able to have the people who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are you in mind?
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
It could just be the woman who is at two car seats, what would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, he would tell him for not having long legs, let me more <unk> a louder <unk> feet more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we did this, and we would give the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are all <unk> to everybody.
But let our children be true.
I think that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
They went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, will become a <unk> change in their own morning.
So let's do it.
On the five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
So initially initially would say it rights, but it was a prisoner for other <unk> and in the company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center couldn't escape it.
He later <unk> it would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who had a <unk> engineer with a <unk> mother teacher from elementary school, between the two made by giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to want to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are going to be used so <unk> to their convictions who think that we need to use all the possible means for everyone to live like them.
A few months before he arrest him was with me and explained that in the last weekends, he was with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to go to training Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came up with the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I played my father <unk> my father helped me to hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to the point to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that shot him shot at the little light light on the goal, and to surprise you, especially of me, the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
<unk> such child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. but just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a van with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground tower of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt the other 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone was a moment of packing and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white but being the new of the silent class and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like your race or your religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I had to test my mind was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in juvenile violence, as I had been victim to <unk> almost my entire life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who had done friendship, was Jewish age.
It took several days to go out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and I felt very proud of being able to beat the barrier that all life was made to me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
Every life had been taught to me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay were bad <unk>
I had a chance to work with gay players there, in a show, and I could see that many of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people in exactly the way as I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that would be homosexual but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest with my <unk> and I was helping me to see that the race of people, religion or religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the <unk> eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred inside you.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done this because I hope that someone, one day, who is to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though I was going to join this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against these <unk> acts -- like rejection to my father's actions.
So with this <unk> I put here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or a disease, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that's projected in your minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's in 3D and it has sound <unk> of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
Do you feel your body, your pain, your hunger your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It's got memories, as a childhood moments you project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie you're you who experience everything else.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you know, you and you.
There's nothing to do more directly.
At least, I know I have an <unk>
I don't know that you are aware.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just the robots that we need to get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Now, science, by nature, is objective of power.
<unk> by nature, is subjective space.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience is studying the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Bannister said, <unk> is the time for science to make science <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain, and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand a lot better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you saying that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness -- the questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy trouble with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the core mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is it an inner movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do they operate the <unk> how the <unk> are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms -- all of these are questions about how objective works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> <unk> how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why it's all of behavior accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't really have to say.
I'm a heart <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for reasons for reasons.
I think we're going to tell us at this point.
So we have a wonderful piece of explanations -- great. We got used to this, physics explains the chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> crazy before being able to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
And your crazy idea is that there is no such problem as a hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective film, it includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of your brain behaviors -- and that's where all that needs for explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just deny that the observation of consciousness is sad.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time that we have, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as the <unk> <unk> space, the mass and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
Instead, they considered fundamental principles, and there is built the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of fundamental concepts -- and then <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws of <unk>
I think that's the situation that we found in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- the space of space, time, mass, <unk> -- then for a matter of logic, you have a list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not a question of science, right?
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that govern consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the time, the mass, the physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want to do fundamental laws so simple that we could fit them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we could fit them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> all of all, <unk> by mind, every system is aware, not only humans, the dogs, the flies -- flies, the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when I think "Oh, you always go to the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But the thinking is that perhaps photons can have some certain <unk> <unk> some alien precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and dough, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to be <unk> it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws of finding the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing, there is awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And they are supposed to be about consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a kind of medium of integration of information, as much significant, as much significant awareness.
But when you get to the worms -- microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller -- but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there's still a level of different consciousness of zero.
In fact offers a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality underlying the underlying reality.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that view, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that I had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think that it tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral terms is not so much the fact the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information -- she has a complicated information processing -- that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
So if this is right, they are having a serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of the intelligent computer systems and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group in a TED talk, right now we have a TED collective consciousness -- a internal film for this whole group of TED -- different from the inner movies on each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that you must have seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is <unk>
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think we're finally going to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal, a very normal, an profile of education.
I went to school, I met with my friends, I was <unk> with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for an award of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice but there's a real problem.
She has actually no <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement.
Years later, being in the second part of teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 minutes in the class, a kid raised her hand and said, "Hey, when you get your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a few good minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
They usually in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with disabled people as inspiration objects.
And we don't know that -- and it's not <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to be there.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to tell you. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid -- <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is a <unk> A <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't get to make it happen.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without the hands drawing with a pen held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because they would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we have disabilities in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I have lost the numbers of the number of times that they've been telling me strange -- to express that I think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was kind of like me to stand up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will inspire people with disability on the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
We have some things.
But the things that we regret are not the things that you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was <unk> by so-called social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the commons.
They are simply using their bodies by getting the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have been sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, I don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know that I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think I am lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load the mobile phone out on the car of the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance from others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: <unk> in life is bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a charge of the stairs has never done it becomes a <unk>
Never.   <unk> at a television screen I'm not going to show the <unk> for people to <unk>
Nor are a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 12-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered <unk> nothing to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people who have disability to be <unk> by getting rid of the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value true achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a kid from 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and the professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of really <unk> thinking about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets them see what I see.
They will allow them to experience what's being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to get <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you <unk> with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what it's running through the field of play at 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds of us, trying to <unk> it with all of his self.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So you know, some videos to show you what the Google <unk> is to use under the helmet, give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> <unk> is a submarine coming up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it on that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know.
The Rift Age, has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap <unk>
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian roller coaster for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video from Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and do a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan.
And when it can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball on the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What will your experience to be when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality will augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group and you see her next hand you see in front of you, in a plastic kind of plastic that you're going to have in front of you -- you don't have to worry about <unk> a <unk>
You can put the strategy.
They just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose their parties, and they miss <unk>
If you lose parties <unk> you like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is send to your <unk>
Good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have information <unk>
So this is <unk> to good equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to stop being <unk>
It will be also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field of field.
They put the ball and <unk>
<unk> a fossil receptor suddenly <unk> a <unk> on the left part of your Norden bombsight -- that a defense behind you is going to <unk> they don't have it, but the system of <unk> <unk>
It would be an area of protection.
Another <unk> you told you, there's a open receiver here.
<unk> the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land yet, the receptor sees it in your Norden bombsight that lights up and can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public is <unk> and the fans have followed the way that they go from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport, because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it only as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think that we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology worth a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show you the world how they live to be <unk>
How much is it that also for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face is forever, of us.
Thank you.
Recently I was <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I spent the southern end of the County <unk> which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Arctic Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide -- being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer head to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much at <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not a practical or practical <unk>
But from the openness, over 1600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will lead to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it releases you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go below <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free of four to five seconds, the body hits for about 120 miles an hour.
The impact it breaks into the bone, some of which are making vital organs.
Most people die in the impact.
The ones that no, they normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that are going to be used by the suicide method will be given to the death of the death that they were <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 steel inches parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are before before they get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we were successful that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were talking about, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officers, officials and psychologists train the new official again.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him about 22 percent of last year when he gets a call from a possible guy called sitting on the <unk> near the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, he looked at Jason talking to an official of the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up to here two times before from New Jersey to try to die from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> he leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind and smart guy in New Jersey had just taken my life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had been <unk>
<unk> damage is they affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved being <unk>
What do you find?
How do you say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you need to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person who you know how it feels like, because you probably won't.
I'll just be there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you won't be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about ending life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be able to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in the life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but finding more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of the 49 percent of the 49 <unk>
It never came there.
I called the <unk> police cop and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that the car of Mike car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been wrong before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be that easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
<unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the bridge, and her son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote a radio called a radio called a <unk> <unk> on the sidewalk <unk> near the northern tower.
<unk> my motorcycle <unk> and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw it, I immediately crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and <unk>
Kevin decided to account that day come back to that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was what made you <unk> and gave him the hope and life is <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "Do you <unk>
He stopped me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have this letter with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase the <unk> events of March and you're one of the reasons that Kevin continues with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We thank God for you.
I really <unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writing, <unk> when I visited San Francisco at San Francisco that night, you were going to be the patient.
<unk> I had to have it <unk>
Now, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events that day and his depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> <unk>
That act, even though I end up his own pain, I was giving me the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They simply want their own <unk> pain.
Usually this is being achieved by three things: you sleep, drugs or alcohol or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
So of those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
For that time, I would give up your hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact with in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those who have jumped from the bridge and lived and can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they leave the railing the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we make, is something that everyone and each of us must be working on to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you not what you are, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question: How do you tell you about that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had eventually achieved the dream that I had had a little girl.
My outside of finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
So by complicated reasons, the ones that I go back later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, <unk> am I starting on.
We were all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the constraints imposed by the color of the skin or the belief of those around us.
They are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years -- a lot of my neighbors, many of my friends, my <unk> even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in your head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always get that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> <unk> but now we know that, really, it's a more complex and mystery of <unk>
Because of my success, I never want to share my story, not because it thought that I'm going to be a bad thing, but for how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have a mom and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the African culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that we celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me: This is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing of man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a beauty <unk> competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for <unk> and <unk> And that night, I won in the bathroom, he won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was the queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when he <unk> remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mother who had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that I was passed my journal magazine that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you get <unk> to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to be done before the surgery and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the female <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, your identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt like I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was born, and he was living in a living life, but he said, <unk> in end of his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 of November we do a global <unk> for the Day Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people that <unk> and it stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live the truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 percent of <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
They'll do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. So thank you first, thank you with all my <unk>
My family network, my parents especially, to my family, who was very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women, young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that his parents couldn't accept it, I took my mom and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- other no. It's just identity identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table the theme that we would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation we should have with parents, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking me questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very little. <unk> Thank you.
In many societies, and tribal societies, the parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts was awarded in 2011, to the <unk> the National <unk> of peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his dad.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies from the beginning, when when when when when when we was born, their birth is not <unk>
It's not economically, not by his father or his mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was <unk> a lot to have a child.
When it comes to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only mother suffering, but the daughter, <unk> daughter <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school members of her brothers.
Until the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when you go into the adolescence, when it's 13 years old, you take it out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and her brothers and his family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that assumption that of course, will even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not only affect the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of her sisters in behalf of the course of honor.
And there's a norm more than <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl has to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't want to.
If you put them with a man who doesn't like it, or if the <unk> with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be a <unk> of <unk>
If you get it very young, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives light to more and more <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to his daughter and the same lesson from honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
They had brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And so much before I died, I thought about her name, and was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I grabbed a line of my name, and wrote, <unk>
And when she did, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years old at my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I must <unk>
You can take it in Canada, in the United States, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of their identity and his name.
One <unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I <unk> the <unk> <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me in different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to show them in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've been asking all of these good values in my school to girls and boys as well.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, pay for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of engaging women in all of political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the 10 years, <unk> got up and raised by the right to the education.
He wrote a day for the blog of the BBC, he offered her same for the documentaries of the New York Times, and spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and nine in October 2012, he was fired on <unk> in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would give him to my wife -- "I've got to <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't give you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of peace, by the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
These few words were a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and he had severe headaches and he had severe headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that stood on my wife's face.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my <unk> smile and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to be fine. Please don't get <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters have learned from her how to resist in the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like every 16 year-old girl.
<unk> when you don't have a task.
They fight with their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is that special in my <unk> that has made so audacious to <unk> so brave <unk>
I mean, I don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> -- where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google 11, but all the work I'm going to talk about here about the brain, I made it before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
Are you still as smart as smart or not?
If you wouldn't be like that, you might be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It was not the grey matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if he didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide on the combinations of combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> to follow life.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul from <unk> for what I decided to be able to try to get the <unk> dose, because there is no clear map that says it in <unk>
I started testing with <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how little changes in the <unk> dose, dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly controversial case, for a few months, I tried a little bit of a typical dose for a <unk> man, and I was amazed when I saw my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types of things, or maybe some <unk> versions.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that I had on the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to <unk> from then I carry better with men.
What it was trying to do to do when we adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, I was to get my intelligence after the disease, and the <unk> my creative thinking -- my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my key point of reference -- how to get these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in similar ways.
They thought that images and ideas were the same thing.
Today there are the ones who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the brain works, for me is a simple one, for most of us, the mental imagery is fundamental to the thinking and <unk> thinking.
And so, after several years, I could find the point right and I have no longer a lot of great mental <unk> the really sophisticated mental <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to do very quickly these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use your imagination only to steer the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty of getting this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to coming to this with two recent experiments that were done by two <unk> groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, which is an functional magnetic resonance -- to represent the brain here, you can see the brain scan by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The spine of the medium shows you the brain scan in that same individual as you <unk> looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining the same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab by Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual <unk>
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, it showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a large gene of brain reactions to the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images -- new people, new animals, and as long as you get a new <unk>
The computer using only the brain information -- using it to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
That blew us up.
We're pretty good about this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you see that same picture, you create the same picture, it creates the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning brain systems that are available today, and its resolution became a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There's a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introducing electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new projection from data projection by images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> they only offer small improvements in the resolution -- not gains for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of some larger, <unk> make better magnets out.
Can we create a much more complex structures with slightly slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make some really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in the <unk> of ingenious solutions and brilliant and bright solutions in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> radio receivers in the MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field they were diagnosed with separate magnetic patterns in the frequencies of <unk> radio frequencies <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing patterns -- we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide in layers our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool for amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it takes a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you this night about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet might be telling someone for the first time that he loves someone to tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to get through in life.
So all I'd become a tough conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through various phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> I didn't hear my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> that for the <unk> of my <unk> and for having <unk> my head was doing a little bit of a child -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear a awkward silence on the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold look at her son.
But I would not say anything, and you go through it.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised the next time I would say something.
This hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready and I was about to get on the female issues on the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
The Gloria <unk> quotes <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And then I took my back up and I went down and I went down and my backs and my backs a little girl with a pink dress -- staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a <unk> question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I take a deep breath again, I got out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something else.
I have the short hair like a boy, and you see a kid, but I am a girl, and you know, you know, as you like to use a pink, pink, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
All right, I'm more from a <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was everything.
What about <unk> <unk>
It was the most easy conversation to ever have ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both we were <unk> one with the other.
And so many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how a feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you a hundred reasons why to get out of my closet it was more difficult to come out of your own, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who had declared online banking is harder to tell them that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than telling your five-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult with respect to how hard to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their walls, a closet is not a place to live in.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
And I had a horse, a horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
I was not a militant lesbian <unk> to fight every kid in four years that would go into the coffee.
I was frozen through fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet -- I was holding my foot gay, and the move just one muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strange that I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world would turn back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have been followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my more memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and to make my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally I got to one where my parents were my parents, people who were known to me years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in St. Petersburg.
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what's your favorite singing program.
Our <unk> Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who we are <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but rather likely to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using doctoral jeans.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could be easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for somebody, but you can get it.
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you can do.
That's how hard conversations are still my strong point.
Ask to anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves getting out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in the cafe had no <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others need to know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If you say to your parents that maybe you might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex ones.
You communicate your truth.
They would never be done by that.
And some of you can get wounded hurt by what they've done, but they never feel sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark question: <unk> <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very <unk> but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is so interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of the <unk> of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I would take a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental fundamental language of intelligence.
Let's go back a walk.
We start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're a space race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept about the Earth -- would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how to certain time in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to do several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through a number of disciplines, that I think, I think, in a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately and adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that are <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them for a number of years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just a equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is an assertion that intelligence is a force -- F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain the open choices with a <unk> force with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yes, to an impending <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintaining the open.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural -- what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have trend more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection is <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system in which they find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could be able to spend multiple animal testing, play games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it didn't be told to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human standing here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it to <unk> a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is going to have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling off the opposite end of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here is successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections on a social network where our friends are constantly fighting and keeps the net well connected.
This same capacity of network network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> we can organize the routes of a boats, and we discovered successfully with success and using the Panama Canal to extend the world's scope to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> we will spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> successfully by increasing assets under their exponential management.
This risk management skill will have huge applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term <unk> the piece -- there was always the concept that if we were doing smart machines, there would be an rebellion of <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades -- we've had all the concept of rebellion -- <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines will first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the other thing, that the urge to take control of all future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence that general intelligence can actually arise out of <unk> instead of being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals to get out of these kinds of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence -- is this: intelligence has to be a physical process that is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the fear of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth works in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit of other stars, orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the acoustic intensity of the stars when planets go through them, and they block a little bit of that light that we go.
The data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their mother.
And together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the ground planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own time.
At the time, this gives up clues about whether these planets we find are livable or not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest one.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from the course of millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a science scientist or the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the sector.
Now, as someone who is very interested in search for life in the universe -- I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, rather than our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered and the planets that we know better and our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world -- shown by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and, in part, is why we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> tracks their surface to search for clues about the origins of life as well as we know it.
<unk> satellites like the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> take samples from the <unk> atmosphere and trying to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> of living on Mars.
But despite the fact that all these images are going to remind us to deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas that are <unk> and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live in.
Let's take the extension of the areas of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> places that are really concerned with Mars.
Even in the most <unk> and more <unk> of the Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen on our forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag them with a great and sad <unk> the implication, and the belief of some that Mars will expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable to Earth.
For a lot that I like the exploration of exploration -- I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there for humanity to humanity is to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will come to us that <unk> really will have place in the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration for exploration, and the Earth's preservation is not <unk>
No, it's actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to understand, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's just more close to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile areas and <unk> in the ground, maybe we could meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment with a <unk> <unk>
A lot of years ago, my entire universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to be advanced to be able to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that are going to have this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to engage the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the easy task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table, where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all right.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to go to night because I had an early flight in Europe following my <unk> and my <unk>
<unk> expensive -- but surely that no more expensive than a <unk> at a half night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, I was right over.
I'm a profession, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that <unk> the heart rate increases the heart of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter of <unk> in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that I could do -- systems that I could do in place, that I could put it out of the bad things happen.
Or at least at least bad things -- you know, the chance of the fact that it is a total catastrophe of it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts don't <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little bit embarrassed he told him about the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing with something called <unk> hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong right.
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you might go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the shape of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not as evident.
I'm going to start with obvious ones.
In the house, you get a place for the things that are lost easily.
This sounds like common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fish, that places the <unk> trees -- where women live and women and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes into the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that lets the <unk> find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they could still find her nuts.
They weren't using smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing keys for the car, and <unk>
So at home, <unk> a place for the keys, a hook along to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular drawer for your passport.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and you are <unk> with it, you will always be there when you get them up.
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card, license from driving, passport, <unk> for yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can be easy to <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
